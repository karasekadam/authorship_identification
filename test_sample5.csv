Greetings Sally:
My name is Jeff Dasovich.  The Greens have been helping me develop 40 acres
of land that I bought just north of Anchor Bay (a couple of miles up the
hill from Highway One, about 1200 ft or so up) and they suggested that I
contact you.

The property is right in the heart of the Banana Belt and my property faces
south, is protected, and a such is very hot and sunny from late spring
through later summer/early fall.  The property has an abundance of water on
it.  Of course, the possibility of evening fog raises some tricky issues,
and I haven't done soil tests.  In short, while I think there are some
challenges, I'm convinced that there is at least the strong possibility
that I could grow grapes--around 10 acres or so.

I'm sure that you're extremely busy, but I'd be very interested in talking

Energy supply setback: Big generator can't be forced to sell emergency power 
to the state, a U.S. court rules.
By Denny Walsh and Carrie Peyton
BEE STAFF WRITERS
(Published April 6, 2001) 
In a development that does not bode well for California's energy supply, a 
federal appellate court Thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order 
that a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state 
without guarantee of payment. 
State energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect but 
could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant 
off-line for maintenance. 
On March 21, citing ""rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California 
landscape,"" U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction 
against Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation's major generators. 
Houston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20 
percent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell found 
that loss of that production ""poses an imminent threat."" 
But Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
granted an emergency stay of the injunction, saying Reliant has shown ""a high 
likelihood of success on the merits"" of its appeal. 
While not spelling it out, the panel apparently bases its finding on the 
question of the courts' jurisdiction over the energy market. The panel 
directed that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in 
July. 
The decision leaves California's electric grid more fragile, at least 
temporarily, according to the state Independent System Operator, which 
maintains and controls power transmissions. 
It gives the agency no immediate recourse if Reliant chooses to shut down any 
of its plants for maintenance, said ISO Vice President Jim Detmers. 
""It's not going to change anything overnight, and it's not going to change 
anything over the weekend,"" said Detmers. ""But if Reliant decided on a 
unilateral action to take their units off for maintenance ... we definitely 
could have a system emergency."" 
Reliant officials, when told of the ruling, took a conciliatory tone but 
declined to specify their next move. 
""Reliant ... has pledged to keep the lights on in California,"" said company 
lobbyist Marty Wilson, and ""is still of a mind to want to cooperate."" 
Without further comment, the appeals court judges cited a 1980 U.S. District 
Court decision. In that case, 14 cities sued Florida Power and Light Co., 
alleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and 
production of electricity. 
The judge found, however, that the Federal Power Act reserves oversight of 
interstate utilities exclusively to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
He ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sales 
into federal court -- unless it is a request to review a commission order, 
and that goes directly to an appellate court. 
The lawsuit before Damrell was brought by the ISO to force Reliant and two 
other generators to respond to ISO's emergency orders for power, even though 
the agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopelessly 
in debt. 
Because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can't pay 
their bills -- about $14 billion -- some wholesalers want to cut off sales to 
the utilities. 
The other three defendants in the ISO's suit -- Dynegy Power Corp. of Houston 
and Tulsa-based AES Corp. and its marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & 
Trading Co. -- have entered into written agreements with ISO to continue 
supplying emergency power until the FERC decides whether they are required to 
sell to companies that are not creditworthy. 
But Charles Robinson, ISO general counsel, points out that the generators can 
rescind those agreements with 48 hours' notice. 
""My hope is this is a temporary setback,"" said Robinson. He added, however, 
that the practical effect is ""at least for now, we don't have a tool to 
compel them to do what we believe they're obligated to do"" -- respond to 
emergency demands for power. 
Reliant has insisted since the suit was filed Feb. 6 that Damrell has no 
jurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generators 
and the ISO, and that the Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must 
settle any disputes about terms of those tariffs. 
In issuing the injunction, Damrell acknowledged that the FERC has special 
expertise concerning agreements between generators and ISO. 
""Absent the extreme exigencies of the California power crisis, the court 
agrees that a stay pending further action by the FERC would be proper,"" he 
said. ""But those are not the facts here. Electricity is in critically short 
supply. The health and safety of the people of California are potentially at 
risk."" 
Immediately upon receiving the 9th Circuit's order Thursday, attorneys for 
the ISO asked Damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amend 
the suit. The agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its 
view that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge has 
jurisdiction. 
Damrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for Thursday. 
In a further development that could complicate the state's dire need for 
energy, an alternative supplier won a court fight Thursday to bypass the big 
utilities and sell its power on the open market. 
Timber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates four biomass plants 
that produce power for PG&E, obtained a temporary restraining order in 
Sacramento Superior Court that says Sierra Pacific is not required to sell 
its power to PG&E. 
The ruling means PG&E and Southern Edison could lose power as alternative 
energy generators, fed up with months of nonpayment, sue to be able to sell 
their comparatively cheap product elsewhere, including outside the state. ",enron_mail/maildir/dasovich-j/all_documents/10729,4,16,89,3,0,4,101,96,0,0,963,59,92,217,138,4.8753894080996885,107,1206,5901,371,447,26

We should cast a little broader net on this internally--Yoder, Calger,

Thanks.  I'll soften the expropriation language.  I don't think they can 
disclose the $1 million on the product liability case, since the entire 
package appears to be one  negotation, all the pieces of which likely have to 
be agreed to, or no settlement.  But you're point's well taken and I'll try 
to acount for it in the answer.  Finally, I can't see disclosing the fact 
that I'm infringing on someone's patent in my annual report.  Seems like I'd 
have a hard time defending myself in court if they sued me, if I'd admitted 
it to it in my annual report.

		 Subject: Re: Global Case


Jeff,

Sorry, I didn't realize we were attacking this one early over the holiday, 
and I was out of town
until this afternoon. My conclusions differed from the attached write up on a 
few points, but I am
not certain my thinking is the correct way. Here goes:

On the expropriation:

In the write up we say ""We agree with the executive that Global should report 
the expropriation
contingency in its 1994 report since both conditions included in FASB #5 were 
met:  1) sufficient
information to assess that a loss is probable and 2) the loss could be 
reasonably estimated.
Matuto took power in 1994 and it was known that he would nationalize major 
industries.  ""

The book says ""The imminence of an expropriation may be indicated by a public 
or private
declaration of intent by a government to expropriate assess of the enterprise 
or actual
expropriation of assets of other enterpises."" I would argue that Matuto was 
not the government and
therefore unable to enforce these assertions when he was running for office. 
It also says FASB 5
requires the two accrual criteria to be met.

As I understand it, the government took over sometime last year and 
nationalization of resources
was part of their platform. However, the announcement occured in mid-Feb 1995 
that the government
intends to nationalize the mining industry. Also, the taking over of the 
telephone company took
place in January. Since both of these events happened in 1995, I would think 
they should not accrue
in 1994 because the asset was not actually impaired in 1994, in fact the 
asset was fully functional
and operational for the entire financial reporting period. I believe they 
should disclose that the
possibility of expropriation exists in 1994, but I think they should not 
accrue..

I disagree that the company should cease use of the patent infringing 
technology, I believe that
companies frequently make conscious business decisions to infringe upon 
patents. Since I agree that
an accrual is not in order, perhaps a general disclosure regarding patent 
litigation should be
made.

The book states that ""If there are several aspects of litigation, each of 
which gives rise to a
possible claim, then the accrual criteria should be applied to each possible 
claim....""

Thus I think we should break up the product liability suit into pieces. 
They've agreed to pay 1M
for lost rentals. This should clearly be accrued, assuming it hasn't been 
paid yet. The tenants
claims are expected to be settled for 1M, this too should be accrued. The 
surrounding property
claims are not estimable, and therefore should be handled with a disclosure.

Christine

Nope, not at this point.  Rather than start with money, we'd rather start 
with getting the rules (i.e., the IOUs) fixed so that there ain't regulatoy 
roadblock after roadblock standing in the way of deployment.  Sound 
reasonable?

My apologies, but Steve's going to be in a meeting with the Governor from 
about 1:30 to 3 PM today and then is likely on a plane directly thereafter 
returning to Houston.  Likely best to try to arrange the call for tomorrow, 
if that works with Laura.  I'll check Steve's schedule and forward the

Kern Gets Speedy OK; Breathitt Questions Action 
FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River 
Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the 
natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were 
happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved. 
""The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is 
something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort,"" but the 
""precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword,"" warned 
Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision. Although 
she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC 
""should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action."" 
Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action 
expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the 
""extraordinary regulatory treatment"" that the Commission gave it. Critics 
claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler 
Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she 
noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas. 
""...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in 
the California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how 
our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing 
electric generation in California this summer,"" Breathitt said. If anything, 
she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even 
worse than it is. 
There should have been a ""fuller airing of this issue"" at FERC before the 
project was certificated, she noted. ""It would be counterproductive for this 
Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without 
ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more 
importantly, that they will cause no further harm."" 
The Commission majority, however, readily dismissed protests of Pacific Gas 
and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Gas and other California customers, 
that claim the Kern River expansion would degrade service to existing 
customers. They requested that existing customers be given priority over 
expansion shippers. 
""We conclude that the California Action Project will not have undue negative 
impacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines,"" the order said 
[CP01-106. For starters, ""the record does not show that pro-rata allocations 
of primary firm capacity have been a problem at Wheeler Ridge."" Kern River 
reports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at 
Wheeler Ridge will increase to about 527 MMcf/d from 450 MMcf/d as a result 
of this project. At the same time, the design delivery capacity at the 
Wheeler Ridge Meter Station will be increased to about 800 MMcf/d from 598 
MMcf/d to accommodate existing shippers, new expansion shippers and Mojave 
Pipeline shippers, it noted. 
""Therefore, the expanded delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge will be 
greater than the sum of the combined Kern River and Mojave contract volumes. 
The Commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes 
attributable to both PG&E and local production that are also delivered to 
Wheeler Ridge. However, our emphasis is on Kern River being able to provide 
sufficient delivery point capacity for its customers,"" the order said. 
""The solution to the problem of pro-rata allocations of any services at 
Wheeler Ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines, but rather in fixing 
the problem with the take-away capacity and the lack of firm transportation 
path rights on SoCalGas, a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction."" 
The project would increase the ""limited-term, incremental transportation 
capacity"" of Kern River by 135 MMcf/d from Wyoming to California to help 
address the urgent need for additional gas in the West. An estimated 53,900 
horsepower would be added to the pipeline, including three new compressor 
stations, and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and 
an existing meter station. The project, which has been fully subscribed, has 
a targeted in-service date of July 1 of this year. 
Kern River plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the 
project, with the temporary facilities intended to be subsequently replaced 
by permanent 2002 California Expansion Project facilities (which is pending 
at FERC), and the permanent facilities to be incorporated into the design of 
the pipeline's 2002 and 2003 California Expansion Projects. The 2003 project 
recently went through an open season

If memory serves, our filing in California is due on Tuesday.  Steve Bowen & 
Co. should be getting me a draft today based on our discussion a couple of 
weeks ago in Houston.  Soon as I get it, I'll be distributing for review.  
Aim would be to have it in shape COB tomorrow.  Thoughts?

P.S.  Some good news.  Recall from our meeting a couple of weeks ago that I 
mentioned that there were some preliminary filings we had to make in Arizona 
(in order to transact business there) prior to filing for a CPCN.  Well, I've 
spoken with Robin Hill, and those filings have already been made some time 
ago, so that's one less thing to worry about.

Jeff --

Some thoughts -

1. Your key assumption seems to be that this Summer the energy supply manager 
(CDWR buying net short of utility) has enough ""power"" to sell the negawatts.  
I am not so sure.   I belive that a more realistic assumption is that in most 
hours this Summer, CDWR will be buying energy from the ISO.

2. If my assumption is closer to reality, than CDWR will not be able to sell 
""excess"" MWs and pay the customer.  Even if you are right, CDWR buys at 
$80/Mwh (LT contracts delivered today) and sells at $300/Mwh = net benefit to 
deliver to customer of $220/Mwh [unless you are saying the $80/Mwh goes to 
retail rates and $300/Mwh to customer = which is what I say in #3].

3. I think that we should just call a spade a spade.  CDWR should give the 
customer for a negawatt $300/Mwh independent of how they manage their 
portfolio.  The $ should be put into the general expense of power and 
collected through CPUC approved rates.  Had the customer consumed, that Mwh 
would have cost CDWR at least $300/Mwh (and probably more given the increased 
load).  The state and/or customers still spends the same $.  The only 
argument that one could have is that the customer who conserves ""costs"" other 
customers $.  But these other customers should not feel slighted.  Again, 
CDWR was already going to pay the generators.  Why not pay someone who has a 
real business in CA?

4. So let's compute the cost = 

2000 MW x 80 hours [5x16] x $350/Mwh = $56MM for a one month, 2,000 MW 
on-peak curtailment.  

But the other benefit is (a) reliability, (b) less fossil fuel burned = 
cleaner environment, (c) sticking it too those damn greedy generators, and 
(d) probably lower overall prices and costs because lower demand.

Jim

ENA also sold 100 MW of peak power (6x16) to PG&E for 5 years beginning in 
January of 2001 delivered in NP15.  They declined our offer for flat (7x24) 
power delivered in NP15 of $50.90/MWh.  The trade press is claiming that they 
purchased 400 MW from Calpine delivered in the new Greater Bay Area zone for 
around $51/MWh.  I believe that these values are lower than the current 
generation component of PG&E's frozen rates.

PG&E procured these MW's through a traditional rfp.  This is a pretty clean 
bilateral deal done outside of the PX.  We papered the deal using the EEI 
master agreement.

Jeff,

Sorry I was unable to make the call yesterday.  Thanks for the summary.  My
comments and questions are indicated below.

Please fax a copy of Plan B to be at 713 767 6677.


     You suggest starting the ""process"" in Sacramento next week.  I'm not
     sure exactly what this means.  Are we saying we will have a proposal
     or that we will be advocating a process/forum to get all the right
     parties at the table?
     Did we set a time for the next call on Friday?
     With regard to the Issues list, here are a few extra items:
          need to make clear that real price signals should be sent to all
          sectors (not just those that wouldn't vote for Davis anyway) as
          soon as possible
          I cannot imagine a situation in which the IOUs are returned to
          financial stability within 3-6 months; my guess is that it will
          be at least a year
          if IOUs are returned to the procurement role, we need to make
          sure that they have the appropriate risk management tools
          (ability to enter forward contracts, options, etc.)
          if IOUs are returned to the procurement role, we also need to
          have assurances that the situation we have today won't happen
          again;  for example, if the state assigns the CDWR contracts to
          the IOUs and three years from now the market price is less than
          the contract price, what assurances does anyone have that the PUC
          will not try to make the IOUs absorb the difference
          If we want to go to a core/non-core approach, why do we need to
          wait 18-24 months;  it seems to me that we could start that
          process now
          As for legal claims and investigations, we need to make clear
          that we want to resolve all state and federal claims;  the civil
          claims present a different set of challenges for resolution
          as for discounts on receivables, I'm not ready to commit one way
          or another; however, if there are discounts they must apply to
          all market participants - not just the ones that Davis can get to
          the table.

Subject:  Summary of Today's Call/Agenda for Tomorrow's Call


Greetings:
n order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to
send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't
make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were
on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed
anything.

Best,
Jeff

SUMMARY
   Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael
   Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors).
   On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed
   that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate.
   A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would
   take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy
   makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops.
   Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible
   process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face,
   for however long it takes to work out a resolution.
   It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning
   of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento.
   It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to
   be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week.
   There was some discussion regarding the release today of ""Plan B.""  Plan
   B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an
   alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that
   call I received a copy of ""Plan B.""  If you'd like a copy please send me
   your fax number.
   Folks on the call agreed to have the next ""supplier-only"" call-in
   meeting on Friday.
   Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ""ratings
   agency level"" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of
   the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state
   seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates.

The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff
Item #1:       The Credit Issue
   Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start
   tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue.
   Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by
   the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the
   California PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR
   gets paid for power services delivered.
   If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow.

Item #2:       Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution.
   It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's
   meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a
   comprehensive solution.
   Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The
   following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive,
   but a starting point for discussion.
     Utility creditworthiness
        retail rates must reflect costs
     Increase supply
        streamline and otherwise reform the siting process
     Decrease demand
        establish real-time pricing
        implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs
     Create a real market
        Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible
        (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to
        creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months)
        Return the procurement role to the utilities
        Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers
        Within 18-24 months, create a ""core/noncore"" market structure for
        electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural
        gas
     Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector
        Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission,
        generation, etc.
     Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc.
        Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding
        that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)

RESPONSE TO PG&E DECISION TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY
ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL LOCKYER ISSUES STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO PG&E DECISION 
TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY

(SACRAMENTO) - Attorney General Bill Locker today released the following 
statement regarding Pacific Gas & Electric's decision to file for bankruptcy:

""The uncontrolled increase in electricity prices by generators and marketers 
has claimed another victim with the bankruptcy of one of California's oldest 
businesses. While this is a significant and unwelcome development, our team 
of bankruptcy litigators has been
preparing for several months to defend California taxpayers in the event of a 
utility bankruptcy. This morning, I spoke with a PG&E executive, and he 
personally assured me that the utility will honor its legal obligation to pay 
the state for its purchase of energy and
to repay its renewable energy supplier-creditors (""qualified facilities""). I 
am prepared to enforce those assurances in the courts to the extent 
necessary. Over the last several months, our state attorneys have fought hard 
in the courts to ensure that out-of-state
generators continue to deliver adequate electricity and natural gas supplies 
to Californians in spite of the precarious financial condition of the state's 
two major utilities. The health and safety of Californians and the future of 
our economy require that our state not be left holding the bag for greedy 
business decisions of generators, marketers and utilities. Justice requires 
that those who have reaped unconscionable profits at the expense of 
Californians must pay back what they owe. I will use all the considerable 
resources of the law to help our policymakers keep the lights on and the 
bills affordable for every California home and business, to recover 
California tax and ratepayer dollars that have been illegally or unfairly 
taken, and to punish wrongdoers.""

AWARD TO INFORMANTS

""It is possible that one or more members of the public can help with 
information, and if so, the financial reward to such a person or persons 
could be enormous. My office is conducting an aggressive investigation into 
whether energy providers have violated any laws. Over the last four years, 
state and local government agencies have spent billions of dollars in state 
and local taxpayer money to purchase electricity and natural gas. Under 
California false claims law, any person or corporation who obtains state 
taxpayer money by fraud or illegal acts is liable for financial penalties 
that can be as high as three times the actual losses. And anyone who provides 
information leading to the successful prosecution of a false claim action may 
be entitled to a percentage share in that award. Since billions of state 
dollars may be recovered, the award to an informant could potentially range 
from $50 million to the
hundreds of millions of dollars. I am asking any member of the public with 
personal knowledge of any wrongful act which may have resulted in reduction 
in the California supplies or increase in the price of natural gas or 
electricity to contact my office immediately by calling: 1-800-952-5225 (w/in 
CA) or (916) 322-3360 (local or out of state), or e-mail the Attorney 
General's Energy Emergency Task Force at energywhistleblower@doj.ca.gov.""

PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on 
Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into 
California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the 
original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what 
generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will 
expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, 
or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed 
""Gas Accord II,""  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for 
the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD 
contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and 
EAD), to be ""open-seasoned"" at some ""future"" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) 
on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might 
auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any 
specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level 
of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any 
questions, just holler.

This guy sounds like he knows what he's talking about.  I suggest we get 
the repairs done immediately and leave the tile for later.  Can you find 
out if he can finish before next weekend whatever needs to be done to have 
a fire safely?  I've been planning a trip with two friends of mine from 
school for a long time and it would really be a bummer to have to cancel 
it.  Thanks for working on this.

Also, about the $$, mom should have put aside $10,000 from grandpa ($5,000 
from me and Cameron each) that was supposed to go for replacing the 
roof.  This is much more important, so I suggest using that money.

Finally, we can get Jeff's friend Karen to help us with the tiles.  We will

Energy supply setback: Big generator can't be forced to sell emergency power 
to the state, a U.S. court rules.
By Denny Walsh and Carrie Peyton
BEE STAFF WRITERS
(Published April 6, 2001) 
In a development that does not bode well for California's energy supply, a 
federal appellate court Thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order 
that a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state 
without guarantee of payment. 
State energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect but 
could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant 
off-line for maintenance. 
On March 21, citing ""rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California 
landscape,"" U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction 
against Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation's major generators. 
Houston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20 
percent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell found 
that loss of that production ""poses an imminent threat."" 
But Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
granted an emergency stay of the injunction, saying Reliant has shown ""a high 
likelihood of success on the merits"" of its appeal. 
While not spelling it out, the panel apparently bases its finding on the 
question of the courts' jurisdiction over the energy market. The panel 
directed that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in 
July. 
The decision leaves California's electric grid more fragile, at least 
temporarily, according to the state Independent System Operator, which 
maintains and controls power transmissions. 
It gives the agency no immediate recourse if Reliant chooses to shut down any 
of its plants for maintenance, said ISO Vice President Jim Detmers. 
""It's not going to change anything overnight, and it's not going to change 
anything over the weekend,"" said Detmers. ""But if Reliant decided on a 
unilateral action to take their units off for maintenance ... we definitely 
could have a system emergency."" 
Reliant officials, when told of the ruling, took a conciliatory tone but 
declined to specify their next move. 
""Reliant ... has pledged to keep the lights on in California,"" said company 
lobbyist Marty Wilson, and ""is still of a mind to want to cooperate."" 
Without further comment, the appeals court judges cited a 1980 U.S. District 
Court decision. In that case, 14 cities sued Florida Power and Light Co., 
alleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and 
production of electricity. 
The judge found, however, that the Federal Power Act reserves oversight of 
interstate utilities exclusively to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
He ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sales 
into federal court -- unless it is a request to review a commission order, 
and that goes directly to an appellate court. 
The lawsuit before Damrell was brought by the ISO to force Reliant and two 
other generators to respond to ISO's emergency orders for power, even though 
the agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopelessly 
in debt. 
Because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can't pay 
their bills -- about $14 billion -- some wholesalers want to cut off sales to 
the utilities. 
The other three defendants in the ISO's suit -- Dynegy Power Corp. of Houston 
and Tulsa-based AES Corp. and its marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & 
Trading Co. -- have entered into written agreements with ISO to continue 
supplying emergency power until the FERC decides whether they are required to 
sell to companies that are not creditworthy. 
But Charles Robinson, ISO general counsel, points out that the generators can 
rescind those agreements with 48 hours' notice. 
""My hope is this is a temporary setback,"" said Robinson. He added, however, 
that the practical effect is ""at least for now, we don't have a tool to 
compel them to do what we believe they're obligated to do"" -- respond to 
emergency demands for power. 
Reliant has insisted since the suit was filed Feb. 6 that Damrell has no 
jurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generators 
and the ISO, and that the Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must 
settle any disputes about terms of those tariffs. 
In issuing the injunction, Damrell acknowledged that the FERC has special 
expertise concerning agreements between generators and ISO. 
""Absent the extreme exigencies of the California power crisis, the court 
agrees that a stay pending further action by the FERC would be proper,"" he 
said. ""But those are not the facts here. Electricity is in critically short 
supply. The health and safety of the people of California are potentially at 
risk."" 
Immediately upon receiving the 9th Circuit's order Thursday, attorneys for 
the ISO asked Damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amend 
the suit. The agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its 
view that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge has 
jurisdiction. 
Damrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for Thursday. 
In a further development that could complicate the state's dire need for 
energy, an alternative supplier won a court fight Thursday to bypass the big 
utilities and sell its power on the open market. 
Timber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates four biomass plants 
that produce power for PG&E, obtained a temporary restraining order in 
Sacramento Superior Court that says Sierra Pacific is not required to sell 
its power to PG&E. 
The ruling means PG&E and Southern Edison could lose power as alternative 
energy generators, fed up with months of nonpayment, sue to be able to sell 
their comparatively cheap product elsewhere, including outside the state. ",enron_mail/maildir/kean-s/all_documents/5291,4,16,89,3,0,4,101,96,0,0,963,59,92,217,138,4.8753894080996885,107,1206,5901,371,447,26

FYI.  As you know, we're attempting to find a solution to the ""reasonable 
review"" morrass that's impeding utility forward contracting.  For that 
effort, we've worked with the Portland desk to pull together some educational 
materials to use with a subset of California stakeholders that's trying to 
devise a solution to California's melt down.

The attached graphs show 3 scenarios for the state as a whole.  
1) ""do nothing""  
2) for 60% of IOU short position, split the amount 50-50 and 1cover half the 
amount with 10-year  fixed priced power and the other half with 5-year fixed 
priced power.
3) create a portfolio with a) 25% of short position covered by 10-year fixed 
priced power, b) 20% of short position covered by 5-year fixed price power, 
c) 15% covered by 1-year fixed price power, d) 20% covered by May-Sept 
fixed-price power, and e) 15% from the PX.  

The term of each scenario is 5 years.

Because each is priced off our our curves, the average price is roughly 
equivalent for each of the three portfolios.  However, the graph shows (as 
one would expect) that exposure to price volatility is significantly higher 
under scenario 1 compared to 2 and 3.

The goal is to use the illustrative scenarios to persuade the industry that 
in the short run (i.e., immediately) the utilities should be permitted to buy 
a modest amount of power under 5 and 10 terms, and those purchases (if 
undertaken using a ""DealBench-like"" tool) ought to be ""per se"" reasonable.

Alan and I spoke about point #2 on the comparison benchmark.  At this point, 
we may be able to just say it is based on a comparison of the contracts with 
today's forward market and gloss over the exact forward curve we used.  Of 
course if there is a way to come up with a similar number using publicly 
available data (or if we are willing to provide our numbers if pressed) then 
all the better.  In the mean time, should I hold off on using the $13.8 
billion number until I hear back from you about the conversation with Steve?

Also, do I understand correctly from Alan that the $13.8 billion figure is 
NOT comparing the long term contracts California signed with recent spot 
market prices, but rather is a comparison of the contracts to our present 
forward pricing curves?  From you e-mail, it is the latter, I take it.

As to point #1, on the deal last year, we just need a similar ""back of the 
envelope"" calculation on what California could have saved had California 
taken us up on the offers we and others made.  Any guidance on where to get 
that would be most helpful.

Great question.  If you think it would be useful, I can back channel to Loretta and find out.  I'm of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides, so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the court of public opinion.  Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides, instead.  

On the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes, etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other.  In the public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue. Either we end direct access, or granny faces death and destruction.  And that's just not the case. In fact, I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isn't in the cards, period.  

But I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views.  Let me know if you'd like me to find out if Loretta thinks the letter would help her. Could find that out in pretty short order.

Jeff

Yes, it's technically true, but it doesn't seem relevant.  It's a 
technicality.  That is, if at the end of the contract, UC/CSU goes to another 
provider, the rules would require Enron to ""de-DASR,"" after which the new 
provider would submit the new DASR to switch the customer over.  The utility 
stands in the middle of all this.  I don't think this equates to what UC/CSU 
is claiming the problem is.  Might be viewed as a bit ""cute"" by the judge.

Also, the legislation ""fixing"" the prohibition passed our of policy committee 
today in Sacramento and is moving through the Legislature.

You need to worry less about Cameron, because I think that it's one of those 
very deeply rooted Mom/daughter things, and will take time to work out.  

And I sense a phase that she's going through that is just like the one that 
my older sister went through with my Mom around the same age (which I wasn't 
particularly happy about, but I think it's normal, sort of).  I'd be happy to 
talk about it if you want some time.  

I think part of it is going to be that primordial thing where she's starting 
her own gig with Scott and it's going to be like a second ""breaking away"" 
(the one that comes after teen-age-dom).  So it's less about you and much 
more about her (and Scott, to some degree, too).  

I hope I'm not confusing matters more.   

Hugs,
Jeff

FYI - This article is very informative about the options FERC is considering 
to address the California power market situation; no surprises for anyone 
following this closely.  Please note that Chairman Hoecker felt the need to 
emphasize the limitations of FERC's power under the Federal Power Act.


DJ FERC Chief Pledges Action, If Needed, On Calif Pwr Woes
Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.


(This article was originally published Monday)
     WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has 
limited authority to address flawed electricity markets in California and 
alleged price gouging by power producers, but will act to overhaul the 
state's wholesale power markets if necessary, FERC Chairman James Hoecker 
told a congressional panel Monday.

     The commission was ready to act once the results of an expedited staff 
investigation of problems affecting power markets in the U.S. West becomes 
available, Hoecker said in testimony presented to a San Diego field hearing 
of the House Commerce Committee's energy panel.

     ""If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our 
jurisdiction, we will do so,"" Hoecker told lawmakers. And if price gouging is 
occurring ""as some have alleged,"" he added, ""we will respond accordingly, by 
revoking market-based rates or otherwise.""

     However, Hoecker stressed that the commission's authority is limited 
under the Federal Power Act.

     ""The commission has limited ability to relieve the immediate customer 
crisis. Important aspects of this problem are a state responsibility, such as 
authorizing construction of new generation and transmission facilities,"" 
Hoecker testified.

     The commission can't act to limit prices charged by power providers 
""until we have a record supporting such action,"" he said, referring to the 
results of the pending staff investigation.

     Further, he said, the law bars FERC from ordering retroactive refunds to 
San Diego Gas & Electric Co. for the power it purchased this summer to serve 
its retail customer base.

     Hoecker testified before the House Commerce Committee's Energy and Power 
Subcommittee, which is looking into the supply shortages in California this 
summer that have forced San Diego electricity consumers to pay twice as much 
for power as they did a year ago.

     State Mkt Structure Blamed For Crisis



     The hearing comes after much wrangling at FERC, as SDG&E, a unit of 
Sempra Energy (SRE), sought an order setting price caps for power bid into 
the state-sponsored electricity exchange, and power producers sought an order 
allowing cost recovery for lost opportunity sales if the state's independent 
grid operator curtailed sales outside California, where price controls don't 
apply.

     FERC hasn't yet responded to the producers, and deferred action on 
SDG&E's bid for price controls until the staff investigation is completed. 
But it left in place an order allowing the independent system operator to 
limit the price it pays for power, which acts as a de facto cap on prices bid 
into the power exchange.

     Hoecker, while withholding judgment pending the staff probe, appeared to 
place much of the blame for this summer's crisis with the state-mandated 
market structure, which left San Diego consumers subject to spot-market 
volatility.

     And he appeared to suggest that FERC's order directing utilities to 
transfer transmission assets to control of large regional transmission 
organizations, or RTOs, will offer an opportunity to develop a regional 
solution to the power-supply problem.

     FERC deferred to California in restructuring the wholesale market in 
California because its experience with new market institutions such as power 
exchanges and ISOs was limited, Hoecker said.

     Other states, such as Pennsylvania, were ""less prescriptive than 
California in telling the commission how their wholesale markets should 
operate,"" Hoecker noted.

     Now, with FERC's Order 2000 encouraging formation of RTOs, ""the 
commission is in a very different posture with respect to the structure of 
wholesale markets,"" he said.

     ""Large regional markets can be made to work effectively,"" Hoecker told 
the lawmakers, citing the Pennsylvania restructuring as an example.

     Other witnesses were more forceful in criticizing the state-mandated 
market structure.

     By requiring the state's three investor-owned utilities to purchase all 
their electricity from the power exchange and limiting their ability to hedge 
price risks by entering into long-term fixed-price contracts, the state left 
consumers subject to volatility in the state-mandated spot market, said 
officials with Enron Corp. (ENE) and Reliant Energy (REI).

     California's market structure ""placed no economic incentives on the 
default utility providers to look out for the costs that are ultimately 
passed on to their consumers,"" Reliant's John Stout testified.

     ""San Diego's experience offers the Congress an unparalleled opportunity 
to learn from a bungled attempt at deregulation,"" said Michael Shames, 
executive director of Utility Consumer's Action Network.

     Shames and other witnesses warned the congressional committee that 
California's electricity crisis is likely to occur in other regions of the 
country unless steps are taken to free up interstate trade in power and allow 
FERC to better police markets.

     ""California is just the latest problem area in U.S. power markets and, 
unless policymakers act quickly, it will not be the last,"" said Enron Corp. 
(ENE) Steven Kean executive vice president.

     ""Unless Congress and FERC are willing to address the interstate issues 
that are beyond the jurisdiction of state legislators and regulators, I 
predict that our experience in San Diego is indicative of what others will 
encounter in trying to create a competitive electricity market,"" said Edwin 
Guiles, Sempra's president of regulated operations.

     ""This electricity crisis is not a California-only problem,"" said Rep. 
Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., who represents San Diego and requested Monday's 
hearing.

     ""We will continue to be in this mess if state and federal officials 
don't work together to find long-term solutions to the flaws in the 
marketplace,"" Bilbray said.

I think it's fuzzy enough that two good lawyers could give two different 
views--wanted to ensure that all analytic bases are covered.  But I just 
talked to Mike and he and I think, at least preliminarily, that the PUC could 
do this absent legislation.  He's going to do the analysis.  Likely better to 
let Mike go ahead and do the analysis and if we want to get other opinions, 
we can make that decision at that time.

One last thought:  If the PUC could do it, that might be Davis' preference.  
That way, he and his people are in charge.  But it may be difficult 
(impossible) for the Legsilature to resist and Davis may not have the clout 
to get them to back off.

We're getting a lot of inquiries about Enron's role in California's de-reg

I spent about 3 hours on Friday with a Sac Bee reporter (Dale Kasler).  He'll

Sue spent time with a NYT reporter discussing the same. Some common themes

1. I am flying out on Tuesday morning, do you both have dinner plans?
2. Recommend where to stay (meeting at 50 Fremont at Pillsbury)?

Here is some additional information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning.					

The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session.
The Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session.

The Legislature's options: 
1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning.
2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch.  However, they can pass a ""waiver,"" which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning.
3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.

In short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.

Where to from here?
Through its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July.
Just before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that ""...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'"" and ""...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end.""  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison.  The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however.  
Given the Senate's view, and the open hositility between Davis and Burton, Davis' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis' Edison bill.  It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough.
With the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive.
Finally, Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said:
Burton and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without ""adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses.""
He doesn't know why ""the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session.""
With all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others.

If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.

We'll report back with additional information as we get it.

We're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few 
months.  But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my 
mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday, I wanted to throw out some 
observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead.

OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for ""price gouging"" is 
increasing.

The administration is hell bent on finding a ""fall guy.""  The price spikes 
pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an 
easy way out.   His press release following the hearing renewed the call for 
""refunds.""  On my panel, Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her 
with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to 
marketers.  And Carl Wood's remarks were extreme.
At the Barton hearing, a liberal democrat (Filner) and a conservative 
Republican (Hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds. Bilbray joined the 
""gouging"" band wagon.
The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a ""real"" investigation, with 
hearings, testimony, data discovery---the works. 
On the positive side, the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak, his analysis, and 
his remarks on the panel.  Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature 
of California's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single 
participant as the culprit.  He also stated that just everyone's just acting 
in their own self-interest, responding to the screwed incentives embedded in 
the structure.

IMPLICATION--It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of 
getting fingered.

In the best case, the clamoring for a ""refund"" subsides.  In which case, the 
only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the 
risks of getting fingered.
In the medium case, investigations find that Enron (like others) ""played by 
the rules,"" but the rules stunk, and Enron profited at the expense of 
California consumers.  ",enron_mail/maildir/dasovich-j/all_documents/1463,12,6,39,3,0,0,1,1,0,0,316,18,35,69,38,4.841772151898734,33,413,1943,123,200,0

Hi Lee:

Looks great.  Could you do me a favor?  You have ""generating company"" rep on

This is a very good synopsis of the gas crimes trials in California.  Pleas=
e=20
note comments of Assembly Republican John Campbell---perhaps the sole brigh=
t=20
spot in the California Legislature...

Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation

Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20
California Assembly
has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the=
=20
state=01,s current
energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane=
d=20
heavily on a
report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility=
=20
Southern California
Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.

But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu=
ral=20
Gas -- is not
ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i=
t=20
recently presented
as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.

As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP=
UC=20
are pointing
the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde=
r=20
prices through
affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against =
El=20
Paso is The Brattle
Group=01,s study of the California market.

Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=
=20
of the
California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20
Group=01,s market
study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not=
=20
caused by normal
market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=
=20
which Assembly
members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=
=20
the California
market.

El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=
t=20
presented to
legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=
=20
of factors, not a
conspiracy, caused the price run-up.

Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=
so=20
to conduct
work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20
concluded that the
increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=
=20
main culprits in the
California gas price imbroglio.

Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=
=20
said he
""didn=01,t see any smoking gun"" in either report.

""We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20
Study and a little
on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20
legislature is the best
place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,"" Campbell=20
said. ""I believe FERC
is looking at this situation "" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=
=20
appropriate place.""

Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=
=20
give support
to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. ""It=01,s being pushed=20
basically by the Public
Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion"" by=20
pipeline companies to
push up gas prices in California, he said.

The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20
assembly when
it had failed on the federal level: ""There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=
t on=20
natural gas but on other
things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the=
=20
finger elsewhere for
the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein=
g some=20
of that with the
public utilities commission.""

Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20
prices is a different
matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=
em=20
to have taken
on a life of their own.

The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=
=20
litigated effort to
force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20
participants. Following
on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=
=20
The Brattle Group
report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20
major pipelines that
serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.

Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=
=20
requested data
contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20
process to move
forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=
=20
access to evidence
(GD 4/23).

Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=
=20
case. The commission
recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a=
=20
large block of
pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20
addressing the California
Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th=
e=20
California border
controversy obviated the need for more investigation.

The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a=
=20
hearing into
whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv=
e=20
up the price of gas
delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place=

this summer. (RP00-

Power deregulation backfires in infancy (9.27.2000)
MANY OFFICIALS SAY IT WILL WORK EVENTUALLY 
BY STEVE JOHNSON
Mercury News 
With its residents reeling from surging summertime electricity bills, this 
coastal state's deregulated energy market has triggered bitter accusations, 
legislative hearings and a push to re-regulate the whole system. 
Sound familiar? Except this isn't California. It's New York, one of 23 other 
states that are ending what has been for decades one of government's key 
functions -- keeping tight control on the price of power. 
The great national experiment to open the sale of electricity to competition, 
which California has been largely credited with pioneering, was supposed to 
lower prices by freeing consumers from the monopolistic grip of government 
regulated utilities. Indeed, energy officials in many states retain hope that 
it eventually will do that. 
But throughout the country, a sense of foreboding has overtaken people like 
Susan Peckman, who manages Peckman's Liquor Store in Pearl River, N.Y. Hers 
is the only state outside California so far where consumers have been exposed 
to the discomfitting impact of fully deregulated prices. And she doesn't feel 
liberated. 
``There's nothing we can do about it,'' said Peckman, who estimated that her 
store's electricity bill has jumped about 20 percent this summer over last 
year's. Faced with the option of paying it or closing down, she added, 
``you're between a rock and a hard place.'' 
It has been four years since California became one of the first states to 
pass an energy deregulation law. Yet the movement to revamp the way power is 
sold in this country remains mired in a ``prolonged and muddled transition,'' 
according to a study published this month by Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates and the Arthur Andersen consulting firm. 
It's unclear when or even if that transition will ever be completed. In many 
parts of the country, public officials are terrified of plunging ahead with 
deregulation, given the high prices and other problems in California and New 
York. Some even harbor suspicions that California has led the nation astray 
by promoting an idea that is inherently flawed. 
California Public Utilities Commissioner Henry Duque said he encountered that 
attitude during a summer meeting of the National Association of Regulatory 
Utility Commissioners in Los Angeles. 
``I had other commissioners coming up to me saying, `What the hell is going 
on here,' '' Duque said. ``They were concerned. I think their thought was, 
did we in California see something that was wrong with deregulation but 
weren't going to level with them now that they had started down the path?'' 
Actually, the federal government bears much of the responsibility for 
initiating the drive to ease public control of electricity markets. 
Hoping to encourage new sources of electricity, Congress passed laws in 1978 
and 1992 that forced utility companies to buy increasing amounts of the power 
they use from other, unregulated energy suppliers. In 1996, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission also made it possible for other firms to ship 
their power over the high-voltage lines the utilities owned. 
Consumers were looking for a change, too. By the mid-1990s, the service 
provided by utility firms had become a sore subject. California had some of 
the highest utility rates in the country, and the electrical system's 
reliability was under fire. 
If only other companies could be lured into the market to compete, it was 
widely assumed, prices would plummet and overall customer satisfaction would 
improve. 
New York, New Hampshire and Rhode Island passed laws or made administrative 
rulings to deregulate slightly before California, where deregulation was 
approved in September 1996. 
Rhode Island and Massachusetts were first to give residents the ability to 
choose which company sold them their electricity. But because of its size and 
much publicized deliberations about its plan to deregulate during the 1990s, 
California was labeled the national leader on the issue. 
In many ways, however, deregulation in the state has been a flop -- at least, 
so far. 
Californians have had the right to pick their energy supplier since March 31, 
1998, when the electricity market was officially unfettered. That ability to 
choose was seen as an essential way to spur competition and, ultimately, 
lower energy prices. 
But as of Aug. 15, less than 2 percent of California's homeowners, businesses 
and others had seen fit to drop their local utility for some other supplier. 
By contrast, in Pennsylvania -- one of 13 other states that now let people 
choose -- 10 percent of customers have switched. 
Critics say that's a misleading comparison since Pennsylvania, unlike 
California, gives an energy price discount to consumers who make the switch. 
Nonetheless, Pennsylvania officials are clearly happy about how deregulation 
is working. 
A study in August by Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge concluded that electricity 
competition will result in 36,400 new jobs and a $1.4 billion boost in 
personal income across the state by 2004. 
``We do not anticipate the problems in Pennsylvania that you have out there 
in California,'' said Kevin Cadden, a spokesman with that state's Public 
Utility Commission. ``I am not nervous at all.'' 
A study this summer by the non-profit Center for the Advancement of Energy 
Markets, which promotes deregulation, found that Pennsylvania has pushed 
electricity competition more effectively and quickly than any other state. 
Others listed in order in the top 10 were New York, Maine, Massachusetts, 
Texas, Nevada, Maryland, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Connecticut. California 
was 16th. 
But consumers may have a different measure of success: whether their lights 
will stay on and how much electricity will cost them once government controls 
are removed. Unfortunately, in the two states where prices have been fully 
deregulated, the evidence is not encouraging. 
In San Diego, the first place in California to have its state-mandated cap on 
utility rates lifted under deregulation, electricity bills for many consumers 
this summer doubled, while power blackouts also rolled through Northern 
California. New York's experience wasn't quite as bad. But in the few 
counties there that were exposed to fully deregulated electricity rates this 
summer, the average residential bill rose 22 percent. 
Investigations are under way in California and New York to determine what 
happened. Nonetheless, the problems in both states have been largely blamed 
on an insufficient supply of power plants to meet their demand for 
electricity, which has forced consumers to pay just about whatever 
power-producing firms want to charge. 
``It's the piece that the economists missed'' when deregulation was touted 
several years ago, said Mike Donovan, a spokesman for Orange and Rockland 
Utilities, Inc., which supplies power to Susan Peckman's Pearl River liquor 
store, among other parts of New York. ``There isn't sufficient generation to 
really administer a full-scale competitive market.'' 
Ralph Cavanagh of the National Resources Defense Council in San Francisco 
maintains that deregulation has been unfairly maligned because the dearth of 
power plants has made it impossible for consumers to benefit from 
competition. Once that and some other problems are fixed, he said, ``I'm 
confident we'll have a more orderly market in the future.'' 
Others are growing nervous, however. This summer's difficulties have spurred 
calls to significantly stall or even reverse deregulation in North Carolina, 
Nevada, New Mexico, Minnesota, Oregon and Alabama, among other states. 
A Wisconsin consumer advocate recently chuckled over the phone as she read 
aloud a story about California's energy crisis, noting that such news made 
her opposition to deregulation much easier. 
``I am absolutely convinced that we are on an inexorable march toward the 
choice model,'' said Ken Malloy, president of the Center for the Advancement 
of Energy Markets. But he acknowledged that the experience in San Diego and 
New York ``is undeniably a bad thing that has happened to this movement, and 
it will set us back.''

Paul:

Got your voice mail regarding Anthony Pescetti running for a FERC seat.  Here are some quick thoughts.  Sue likely has some additional experiences and information to share.  Be happy to discuss further.

Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area.
Was a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature.
Republican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that Rod Wright chairs).
Don't recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like.
In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.  It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated.
When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.
Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.
And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led.
Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.

I'd be happy to talk with him, but if we need someone at the Rick level to contact him, that's great, too.  Just let me know.

State lowers estimate of energy costs 
Consumers might see rates decrease 
Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau <mailto:lgledhill@sfchronicle.com>
Saturday, October 20, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle 

URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/10/20/MN39027.DTL>

Sacramento -- The state lowered its estimate yesterday of how much it will cost to buy power -- suggesting that lower rates could eventually be the result. 

Officials of the Department of Water Resources said the state will need $17. 2 billion to buy power through the end of 2002 -- about 20 percent less than previously estimated. 

The agency began buying power on Jan. 17 when the state's three investor- owned utilities were no longer considered credit-worthy. At the time, prices on the spot market reached upwards of $450 a megawatt hour. Now, however, prices average $30 a megawatt hour. 

""Circumstances have changed,"" said Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting, which is a consultant to the Department of Water Resources. ""Conservation has helped, we think the DWR contracts have established reliability in the market. We have broken the back of the spot market."" 

Earlier this year, the state signed 56 long-term contracts with various generators to purchase power. Those contracts, which were inked when prices were at their peak, have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the PUC, 

and Gov. Gray Davis' administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts. 

But the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day. The rest comes from the spot market -- purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed. Prices on the spot market have dropped, in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive. 

It is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs. If the projections hold, the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue $12.5 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases. 

At the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs, they blasted the state Public Utilities Commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers $8 billion. 

Administration officials and state Treasurer Phil Angelides said a PUC decision to delay the suspension of direct access -- the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power -- will shift higher costs to smaller customers. 

The PUC proposed the ban on direct access in June but didn't adopt the policy until Sept. 20. During that period, the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent. 

""What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis,"" Angelides said yesterday. 

He urged the PUC to reverse its decision, setting the date back to July 1. 

But Lorretta Lynch, president of the PUC, said the delay was at the request of the administration and the Legislature. 

She also objected to Angelides' numbers, saying that the PUC estimates the direct access load at 8 percent. The commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to July 1, and action will be taken at the next PUC meeting, she said.

Attached is a rough draft of some scenario development around the PX credit 
and rate issues.  Few points:

Apologies in advance for any errors and inaccuracies.
Given time crunch, the model developed is quite crude and will need 
refinement (to be sure).
The bankruptcy scenario is included (scenario 4), but (again, given the time 
crunch) has not been analyzed to the same extent as the other scenarios.  
Tribolet should be able to provide good insights there, however.
The exposure has not been calculated since GA does not have the numbers, but 
EES should be able---once there's agreement on scenarios and 
probabilities---to run the numbers very quickly.
I've assigned my view of what the probabilities are.  These are key inputs 
and the team will need to scrub them thoroughly.
For ease of use by all, and given time considerations, I've done the 
conceptual model in word format, rather than excel.  It will be simple to 
translate this conceptual model to a spreadsheet model (in excel).

Best,
Jeff

I think Dennis, Shawne and I were supposed to work more on #2, but since I 
can't recall, I'm sending to all.

First, I apologize.  I tried to work directly with the excellent spreadsheet 
Carolyn put together, but I kept fumbling, butchering, etc.  So I canibalized 
her great stuff and created a new spreadsheet, attempting to incorporate the 
""clarifications"" (yeah, right) that Prof McCullough distributed via email, 
and the stuff we talked about during break (i.e., timing of cash flows).  The 
answers are at the bottom of the work sheet.  And I've also included the 
report (though I did not peruse it for errors, relevancy, etc.).  

My  biggest concern is question 6.  My answer (despite some outliers) sez 
that there ain't no loan in June.  (This may mean my spreadsheet's got a 
fatal flaw--significant probability.)

Finally, doing a series of 1,000 trials resulted in some considerable 
variability across runs--again, could be due to screw up on my part--so the 
answers I generatd comes from a run of 5,000 trials.  (If you run the sheet, 
beware, 5,000 takes some time, unless you've got DSL or something.)

Let me know if this is completely out to lunch, or if you're coming up with 
something remotely similar.

Financial 
California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks
Peter Behr
? 
07/06/2001 
The Washington Post 
FINAL 
Page E01 
Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved 
California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to 
recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying 
they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 
billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. 
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is 
seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term 
contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for 
Davis. 
""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get 
us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. 
""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you 
want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" 
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a 
California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close 
to the negotiations. 
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the 
amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach 
a compromise. 
""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told 
reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I 
may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to 
conclude on Monday. 
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides 
toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. 
Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, 
drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at 
sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. 
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, 
chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid 
manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in 
refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. 
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for 
all sides, is closed to the public and media. 
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and 
his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the 
parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report 
confirmed by sources close to the talks. 
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant 
Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for 
failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers 
have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off 
various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. 
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's 
commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but 
now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's 
electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher 
refund figure, some energy analysts believe. 
Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an 
overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have 
to pay for energy under those deals. 
California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed 
deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at 
volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so 
did the state's electricity bills. 
In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating 
long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so 
far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power 
for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. 
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was 
paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and 
considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy 
analysts say. 
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political 
pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's 
controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that 
reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count 
as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" 
according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. 
Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. 
""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said 
Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" 
standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the 
overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. 
""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" 
said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight 
committee for the California grid. 
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room 
""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, 
sources said. ",enron_mail/maildir/dasovich-j/sent/11863,4,1,1,0,0,0,19,1,0,0,947,46,96,160,129,4.921858500527983,96,1259,5920,336,447,44

TEXAS JOURNAL --- Energy Traders Cite Gains, But Some Math Is Missing ---- By 
Jonathan Weil Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

Volatile prices for natural gas and electricity are creating high-voltage 
earnings growth at some companies with large energy-trading units. But 
investors 
counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road. 
 
  Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the 
biggest 
players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy 
Inc.'s 
stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now trades 
for 
41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will be, according 
to 
First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the largest trader of 
gas 
and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled this year to $84.875, 
or 
60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s stock has jumped 61% 
this 
year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings. 
 
  Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price 
swings 
and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional 
markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, while 
supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for electricity 
have 
prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or 
fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for traders. 
 
  But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' 
recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these 
profits 
depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the details 
of 
which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove wrong. And 
because 
of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, it's difficult for 
investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market 
changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions. 
 
  ""There could be a quality-of-earnings issue,"" says Tom Linsmeier, an 
associate 
professor of accounting at Michigan State University, who co-authored the 
U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules on market-risk disclosures for 
financial instruments. ""There certainly might be great volatility that could 
cause what now looks like a winning, locked-in gain to not arise sometime in 
the 
future."" 
 
  The companies reject any suggestion that there may be quality problems with 
their earnings. 
 
  But at the heart of the situation is an accounting technique that allows 
companies to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize 
from energy-related contracts and other derivative instruments in future 
periods, sometimes stretching over more than 20 years. 
 
  So-called mark-to-market accounting is mandated by accounting-rule makers 
when 
companies have outstanding energy-related contracts on their books at the end 
of 
a quarter, such as agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over a 
period of time at certain prices. Under those rules, companies estimate the 
fair 
market values of those contracts on their balance sheets each quarter as 
assets 
or liabilities. Changes in the value of a contract from quarter to quarter 
then 
are either added to or subtracted from net earnings. 
 
  If, for instance, the market price for natural gas rises above the price 
specified in a company's contract to buy gas, generally the company will 
record 
an unrealized gain. That gain is recognized as income and recorded as an 
asset 
on the company's balance sheet. At the end of each quarter, the contract is 
revalued. The value of the previously recorded asset is increased, and any 
increase in unrealized gain is recorded as additional income. Conversely, if 
the 
market value for gas falls, and the value of the contract has declined, any 
change in the contract's value is recorded on the company's balance sheet, 
and a 
loss is recorded on its income statement. e 
 
  Yet in their financial reports, the companies only vaguely describe the 
methods they use to come up with fair-value estimates on the contracts. 
Increasingly, quoted market prices offering independent guidance are becoming 
readily available for several years into the future. However, with some 
long-term derivative instruments, particularly electricity contracts, future 
market prices don't extend far enough to cover the full life of those 
contracts. 
And in those cases, companies are allowed to base valuations on their own 
undisclosed estimates, assumptions and pricing models. 
 
  ""Ultimately they're telling you what they think the answer is, but they're 
not 
telling you how they got to that answer,"" says Stephen Campbell, an analyst 
at 
Business Valuation Services in Dallas. ""That is essentially saying `trust 
me.'"" 
 
  Accounting-rule makers at the Financial Accounting Standards Board have 
debated the subject of how to value energy-related contracts extensively in 
recent months. ""Two companies in similar circumstances might apply different 
methods to estimate the fair value of their energy-related contracts and may 
arrive at widely different values,"" an FASB task force studying the issue 
wrote 
in a June report. ""Those differences lead to the question of whether some of 
the 
methods in practice yield estimated amounts that are not representative of 
fair 
value."" 
 
  Despite this concern, FASB isn't inclined to offer any explicit guidance 
for 
how such contracts should be valued. ""There are just too many models and too 
many different types of instruments for us to have a one-size-fits-all type 
of 
model,"" explains Timothy Lucas, FASB's director of research in Norwalk, Conn. 
 
  One way to determine the size of a company's unrealized gains is to compare 
the change in the values of net assets from risk-management activities from 
quarter to quarter. Some companies also disclose how much they're adjusting 
their cash-flow statements to reflect unrealized gains that have been booked 
as 
earnings. That's how one can determine the size of the unrealized gains at 
Dynegy and Enron, for example, the two companies confirm. 
 
  A reporter's examination of Dynegy's financial filings shows the company's 
earnings are highly dependent on unrealized gains from risk-management 
activities. For its most recent quarter, ended June 30, Dynegy reported 
earnings 
of 38 cents a diluted share -- 71% of which came from unrealized gains, the 
company confirms. (The company's per-share earnings would have been 20 cents 
higher if not for a one-time stock dividend.) For all of 1999, Dynegy 
recorded 
$115 million in unrealized gains, accounting for 51% of its earnings. 
 
  Enron confirms it booked $747 million in unrealized gains from 
risk-management 
activities during the second quarter, more than the company's total $609 
million 
in earnings before interest and taxes. Absent unrealized gains, the company 
would have reported a quarterly loss. For the quarter, the company reported 
earnings of 34 cents a diluted share, up 26% from a year earlier. 
 
  But not all companies disclose enough information for investors to 
calculate 
how large their unrealized gains are. El Paso says that's the case with its 
own 
quarterly reports, which disclose short-term assets and liabilities from 
risk-management activities -- but not long-term risk-management assets and 
liabilities. 
 
  For the second quarter, El Paso reported that its energy marketing and 
trading 
unit earned $152 million before interest and taxes, 24 times what it earned a 
year earlier. In an interview, El Paso's chief financial officer, Brent 
Austin, 
says unrealized gains represented about a third of that total. He says most 
of 
the cash from those gains will materialize within a year. 
 
  In its financial reports, Dynegy highlights the uncertainties with some 
contract valuations. It explains that with some long-term contracts for which 
market-price quotes aren't available, ""the lack of long-term pricing 
liquidity 
requires the use of mathematical models to value these commitments . . . 
[using] 
historical market data to forecast future elongated pricing curves."" Dynegy 
cautions that actual cash returns may ""vary, either positively or negatively, 
from the results estimated."" 

 But like Enron, El Paso and others, Dynegy provides scant details about its 
mathematical models -- such as the assumptions they use for market volatility 
and long-term price forecasts for natural gas and electricity. Nor is the 
company required to disclose more. 
 
  ""The disclosure mentions risks,"" says John Cassidy, an analyst who tracks 
Dynegy for Moody's Investors Service in New York. ""But I don't know that the 
disclosure offers enough detail for you to be able to quantify how much risk 
there is."" 
 
  El Paso's filings warn that ""because the valuation of these financial 
instruments can involve estimates, changes in the assumptions underlying 
these 
estimates can occur, changing our valuation and potentially resulting in 
financial losses."" Enron cautions that the values it assigns to various 
transactions are based on ""management's best estimate."" 
 
  The companies are required to disclose what they think their maximum 
potential 
single-day risk-management losses might be, figures that also are based on 
various undisclosed market assumptions. But energy traders cite competitive 
reasons for not disclosing more. 
 
  ""You don't necessarily want to tip off everyone to what you're doing,"" says 
John Harrison, chief financial officer for El Paso's merchant-energy unit. 
 
  Echoing remarks by executives at other energy traders, Enron's executive 
vice 
president and chief accounting officer, Richard Causey, says Enron runs a 
relatively balanced portfolio and that the estimates factored into his 
company's 
valuations are conservative. In large part, he says, those estimates are 
based 
on quoted market prices where available. Where they're not available, Mr. 
Causey 
says Enron bases its estimates in part on long-term pricing trends, as well 
as 
the company's own trading experience, which dates to 1990. 
 
  Further, Mr. Causey says, Enron's unrealized gains don't depend heavily on 
gains from long-term contracts that extend beyond the periods for which 
market 
quotes are available, reducing the potential for significant earnings 
revisions. 
The average length of Enron's risk-management contracts is just two years, he 
says. To be sure, though, some of Enron's electricity contracts extend for 25 
years. 
 
  ""We're getting the cash in quicker than you might think,"" Mr. Causey says. 
""They don't stay unrealized very long."" 
 
  El Paso says its contracts have an average life of six years, with some 
running as long as 20 years. Dynegy says the longest risk-management 
contracts 
for which it uses mark-to-market accounting are 10 years, though it doesn't 
disclose an average length. Dynegy's chief financial officer, Robert Doty, 
says 
96% of the company's gas contracts close out by 2002, while 75% of its power 
contracts expire by 2003. ""The cash will come in,"" he says. 
 
  As for why the company doesn't disclose the extent of any bias, bullish or 
bearish, it has in the market, Dynegy executives say that information, like 
the 
estimates behind its mathematical models, is proprietary. Such disclosures 
may 
be outdated anyway by the time they could be included in public financial 
filings, says Michael Mott, a Dynegy vice president. Mr. Mott further 
explains 
that Dynegy could be realizing more cash earnings now if it wanted to. But 
""we 
don't see that would be in the best interests of shareholders,"" Mr. Mott 
says, 
because the company figures it can earn more later by leaving much of its 
gains 
unrealized for now. 
 
  Mr. Linsmeier of Michigan State compares the current situation for energy 
traders with the accounting controversies that engulfed subprime automobile 
and 
residential lenders during the late 1990s, though he emphasizes it's too far 
early to tell whether the consequences will be similar. Using so-called 
gain-on-sale accounting (a form of mark-to-market accounting), those lenders 
booked earnings from loans as soon as they were made, rather than having to 
wait 
for them to be paid off, as banks typically do. 
 
  But as interest rates fell in 1998, many customers paid off their loans 
earlier than expected, slashing lenders' profit margins. Compounding matters, 
the market for mortgage-backed securities dried up in the wake of financial 
chaos in Russia and other foreign markets, leaving lenders to bear the higher 
risks of many new loans. 
 
  Many investors complained they were blindsided, in part because these 
lenders 
generally hadn't disclosed their assumptions about prepayment rates and other 
variables. After the crash, subprime lenders routinely began disclosing the 
key 
assumptions used to value their mortgage portfolios. 
 
  At New York University, accounting professor Baruch Lev says investors 
would 
be better served if energy traders' financial filings explained the effects 
of 
hypothetical commodity-price movements on the values of their risk-management 
assets, and disclosed the basic assumptions about future commodity-price 
movements ingrained in their mathematical models. Says Mr. Lev, ""I would like 
to 
see much more disclosure, particularly given that this is now becoming a 
significant component of their earnings.""

	Calif GOP Lawmakers Ask PUC President To Resign 
	
	
	Updated: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 02:14 PM?ET 
	
	? 
	?
	
	
	
	
	LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Assembly Republicans have called for the 
resignation of Loretta Lynch, president of the state's Public Utilities 
Commission, saying they have no confidence that the state's top regulator 
will ""play a constructive role in solving the state's energy crisis."" 
	Assembly Republican Minority Leader Bill Campbell, R-Villa Park, sent a 
letter Tuesday to Gov. Gray Davis on behalf of the Assembly's Republican 
Caucus asking Davis to call for Lynch's resignation. 
	
	
	?
	""With efforts to solve California's energy crisis floundering in the midst of 
unpaid bills, stalled negotiations and rolling blackouts, it has come time to 
ask for the resignation of your appointed president of the California Public 
Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch,"" the letter said. 
	Both Lynch and a spokesman for Davis were unavailable for comment. 
	Lynch, a former attorney, was appointed president of the PUC by Davis in 
March 2000. She is the state's top regulator, in charge of regulating 
utilities, telecommunications, commercial transportation and water companies. 
Before her appointment to the PUC, Lynch was head of Davis's office of 
Planning and Research. 
	The letter says the PUC had a number of opportunities last summer to keep the 
electricity crisis from spiraling out of control by allowing Edison 
International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. 
(PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Sempra Energy (SRE, news, 
msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric to sign long-term power supply contracts 
for about $50 a megawatt-hour, nearly $30 lower than the new long-term 
contracts Davis said the state entered into recently with generators. 
	Lynch's failure to ""ensure that the commission's Aug. 3, 2000, emergency 
order on long-term contracts was quickly implemented has placed the state 
budget at risk for costs now at least 40% higher,"" the letter said. ""This 
hesitancy in a crisis will cost California's economy tens of billions of 
dollars during the next 20 years."" 
	The state has spent more than $3 billion since January buying power in the 
spot market. Davis has asked lawmakers for another $500 million from the 
general fund to continue buying power. If the $500 million is granted, the 
state's commitment to power purchases will surpass $4 billion. 
	State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, however, said last week that the Senate 
Budget Committee will deny further requests for funding unless the PUC carves 
out a revenue stream for the state's Department of Water Resources, the 
agency that is now buying the bulk of the state's power on behalf of the 
cash-strapped utilities. 
	The PUC was expected to release guidelines last week on rates the DWR can 
receive from utilities to pay back the general fund and to issue revenue 
bonds to pay for long-term contracts. But the guidelines haven't yet been 
released. 
	Last year, the PUC said the utilities could enter into limited long-term 
supply contracts to hedge their positions against price spikes. But the 
commission also said it feared if the utilities signed long-term deals with 
generators, liquidity in the wholesale market would be reduced. 
	The Republican lawmakers said the commission is responsible for nearly 
forcing the utilities into bankruptcy. 
	""We have no confidence that Loretta Lynch will play a constructive role in 
solving the energy crisis in the weeks and months ahead,"" the letter said. 
""With Wall Street nervous about repayment of the $10 billion in revenue bonds 
needed to cover the state's energy purchases, the CPUC has been unable to 
perform an adequate assessment of the investor-owned utilities' financial 
situation.""

The Assembly passed the budget late last night.
The Assembly recessed without passing out any energy bill.
There is some talk of a working group being convened beginning next week 
comprised of Legislative staff and industry to continue to try to work out a 
deal.
For now, however, the free world is safe from the CA Assembly and the 
Senate--they've left and all Legislative activity is on hold until the 20th 
of August, unless leadership, or the Governor tries to bring them back early.
The activity now moves to the PUC.

Based on latest info hear's latest assessment of Gov's talk:

I'm in charge.
Here's all the wonderful things I've done thus far to address the crisis 
(likely to include Edison TX talks, since it seems he has no choice but to 
continue that charade).
It's bad and getting worse and we've got to pull together as a state to get 
through it.
Rate increases are a necessary evil that---painful as they are, and they will 
be painful---must be part of the solution; and future increases may well be 
likely.
Blame FERC and the generators, because it's their fault.
Windfall profits is a good idea.

Hey gang,
I've taken the first stab at answering Norm's inquiry... give me your 
thoughts.  Also, Susan, what is the protocol for a case being litigated at 
the CPUC for inquiries like this?  Should we put a disclaimer that the 
information we might provide is protected under Rule 51 or other ""settlement 
discussions only"" protection?



Mr. Pedersen,
First, I'd like to clear-up the nomenclature being used here.  As you know, 
currently SoCalGas doesn't assign ""primary rights"" to deliveries off of any 
interconnecting pipeline.  The establishment of tradeable rights for 
intrastate capacity is among the issues currently under consideration in the 
CPUC proceeding.   However, if what you are asking about is what has been the 
historical or otherwise available receipt capacity for Transwestern 
deliveries at North Needles, then let me offer the following. 

Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could 
physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles receipt 
point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to its 
interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to exceed 
the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09 Bcf/d.  
The 340 MMcf/d difference between the mainline capacity and the physical 
capacity into SoCalGas at North Needles is used to provide firm service at 
our other delivery points at or near the California border, including PG&E, 
Mojave, Southwest Gas, Citizens Utilities, and in the near future, directly 
connected electric generation plants.

Unless someone has a different view, I think that we're all on the same page 
and ready to go.  In that regard, you should have received via fax of the 
language that Sher has put together.  I propose the following.  Please chime 
in with suggestions, alternatives, etc.

Everyone review the language quickly and provide comments.
Simultaneously have Mike Day very quickly draft language (this morning) 
capturing the ideas we've discussed (to make it happen, I think we need to 
provide the specific language).
I will write a note now to the group that's been negotiating the core/noncore 
deal, explaining what we think ought to be included and informing them we'll 
provide legislative language shortly .
Assuming that most in the group buy-in to our proposal, we have 
Hedy/Bev/Scott work with their lobbyists to get it inserted in the language.

Thoughts?

I think that the goal of Govt Affairs should be to (1) ensure that customers 
never on utility service post Jan 17 should not pay, and (2) try and find a 
compromise with the other parties to allow customers who leave by some date 
certain will only pay for the unrecovered cost  on a $/mwh basis.

Basically I am arguing that Enron should require DWR to calculate its unpaid 
balance on some date certain and determine the appropriate surcharge.   I 
know that this is a very long shot.  We should make this recommendation as a 
help to our business teams even if we are going to lose.

Do  we need a conference call with Lobbyists to work through this on Thursday?

We have scheduled a telephone conference of the CESG on Tuesday, December 
12th at 12:00 noon.  The call-in number will be 1.800.377.4827, confirmation 
number 7680189.  I have scheduled 15 lines for 1.5 hours.  We have also 
scheduled a meeting  of the group in Sacramento on Friday, December 15th, at 
10:00 at the Chamber of Commerce's office. 
In the interim, we should all be working toward building the strawpaper 
outlined in yesterday's agenda.  I plan to complete an outline of what we did 
manage to agree to (or identify as proposals) yesterday by the end of 
Friday.  Other responsibilities include: 
preparation by SCE, AES, Enron and the PX of proposals for a ""benchmark"" 
against which, if necessary, individual purchases by the utility could be 
measured for the next 1-2 years;  proposals for longer term benchmarks for 
measuring the reasonableness of the utility portfolio would be helpful, but 
we need to focus on the short-run first.  Also, throw out ideas on tolerance 
bands, including a way to expand/contract the band with changes in 
volatility, and risk/reward mechanisms for utility shareholders.
proposals by SCE, AES and the PX (and any others with ideas) regarding how we 
can address in an overall solution the risk perceived by the utility of 
customer attrition from the utility portfolio (e.g., term commitments, two 
portfolios or a bifurcated single portfolio, etc.);
a proposal from SCE and CLECA regarding how to commoditize the utility 
generating assets (assuming retention of the entitlement to the generation) 
and allocate those assets to small/large customers as the foundational supply 
component of two portfolios (overlaying longer term contracts in the small 
customer portfolio and potentially shorter and medium term contracts in the 
large customer portfolio).
proposals for mechanisms to provide customers with some ability to understand 
the overall cost of utility procurement for comparison with ESP fixed price 
contracts (e.g.,  publication of ""actual"" to date on a monthly basis, 
forecast of fixed price, fixed price product offering).
Obviously, any other ideas you have will be welcomed. 
We failed to make much progress on the design for any stabilized rate or TRA 
undercollections. Consider more carefully (1) whether a ""residual"" (SCE) or 
stand-alone (PG&E) calculation for procurement costs would best serve your 
interests and (2) what level of increase could be tolerated effective early 
2001.  Also consider structural proposals for addressing the TRA 
undercollections prior to the end of the rate freeze. 
Our goal should be to close on a structure, with as many details as possible, 
by Friday, December 15.  Please call me for any reason that will help us move 
this along.

Kern Gets Speedy OK; Breathitt Questions Action 
FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River 
Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the 
natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were 
happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved. 
""The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is 
something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort,"" but the 
""precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword,"" warned 
Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision. Although 
she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC 
""should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action."" 
Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action 
expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the 
""extraordinary regulatory treatment"" that the Commission gave it. Critics 
claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler 
Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she 
noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas. 
""...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in 
the California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how 
our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing 
electric generation in California this summer,"" Breathitt said. If anything, 
she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even 
worse than it is. 
There should have been a ""fuller airing of this issue"" at FERC before the 
project was certificated, she noted. ""It would be counterproductive for this 
Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without 
ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more 
importantly, that they will cause no further harm."" 
The Commission majority, however, readily dismissed protests of Pacific Gas 
and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Gas and other California customers, 
that claim the Kern River expansion would degrade service to existing 
customers. They requested that existing customers be given priority over 
expansion shippers. 
""We conclude that the California Action Project will not have undue negative 
impacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines,"" the order said 
[CP01-106. For starters, ""the record does not show that pro-rata allocations 
of primary firm capacity have been a problem at Wheeler Ridge."" Kern River 
reports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at 
Wheeler Ridge will increase to about 527 MMcf/d from 450 MMcf/d as a result 
of this project. At the same time, the design delivery capacity at the 
Wheeler Ridge Meter Station will be increased to about 800 MMcf/d from 598 
MMcf/d to accommodate existing shippers, new expansion shippers and Mojave 
Pipeline shippers, it noted. 
""Therefore, the expanded delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge will be 
greater than the sum of the combined Kern River and Mojave contract volumes. 
The Commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes 
attributable to both PG&E and local production that are also delivered to 
Wheeler Ridge. However, our emphasis is on Kern River being able to provide 
sufficient delivery point capacity for its customers,"" the order said. 
""The solution to the problem of pro-rata allocations of any services at 
Wheeler Ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines, but rather in fixing 
the problem with the take-away capacity and the lack of firm transportation 
path rights on SoCalGas, a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction."" 
The project would increase the ""limited-term, incremental transportation 
capacity"" of Kern River by 135 MMcf/d from Wyoming to California to help 
address the urgent need for additional gas in the West. An estimated 53,900 
horsepower would be added to the pipeline, including three new compressor 
stations, and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and 
an existing meter station. The project, which has been fully subscribed, has 
a targeted in-service date of July 1 of this year. 
Kern River plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the 
project, with the temporary facilities intended to be subsequently replaced 
by permanent 2002 California Expansion Project facilities (which is pending 
at FERC), and the permanent facilities to be incorporated into the design of 
the pipeline's 2002 and 2003 California Expansion Projects. The 2003 project 
recently went through an open season

months.  With Sue coming back on Tuesday, and in the spirt of our gropes, it 
might be useful to discuss as a group prior to charging ahead.  May even 
result in the same outcome on how to proceed, but a little ""process"" on the 
front end may go a long way toward keeping things on an even keel.  Anywho, 
just my two cents.  Hope your meetings in Salem went well.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Comments on Wholesale Issues

Wood, the Assigned Commissioner in the investigation of wholesale electric 
markets, has asked for comments on the following questions by Friday, 
September 8.  We are an individual party to the case as well as a member of 
ARM and WPTF.  

This would be a good opportunity to get our version of what is wrong on the 
record.  The presentation that Tim and Mary put together for FERC will be 
helpful in answering these questions.  I will take a first cut at drafting 
response to be circulated by Tuesday of next week.  We can take liberties in 
providing responses that go beyond the question asked.

Market Structure:

Are the market conditions currently being experienced (price spikes and suppy 
shortages) inevitable under the current market structure?
Do generators and/or scheduling coordinators have market power?
Is there a need to mitigate such market power?
Which market participants or other entities are responsible for reliability 
planning?
Do California regulatory agencies have adequate jurisdiction to ensure 
reasonable prices and reliable service?
Do the structures and governance of the Cal ISO and PX adequately support the 
goals of providing reasonably priced and reliable service?

Market Rules:

Are there rules which allow or encourage unacceptable market outcomes?
What roles, if any, do underscheduling in forward markets, out of state 
transfers, uniform PX auction prices and ISO real-time and out-of-market 
purchases play in the outcomes being experienced?

Behavior of Market Participants:

What is working and not working in terms of price, reliability, information 
exchange, resource distribution, equity, service quality, and types of 
planned generation?

Good Morning Jeff,

Catherine is out of the office until Tuesday 3/20/01.  Not wanting to keep 
you waiting for a reply, I thought it best to give you some feedback 
immediately.  

The great majority of CAD's customers in CA are core.  CAD does not knowingly 
terminate any current customer prior to their expiration date. The reasons 
why CAD's customers are turned back to the utility are as follows:

1) Upon receiving renewal pricing from the CAD rep,  the customer chooses to 
return to the utility.

2) Understanding that the current minimum margin per meter for our customers 
is approximately $300, those customers that have extremely low annual volumes 
are sent attrition letters and turned back to the LDC, at the end of their 
contract.  We cannot competitively price this type of customer versus the 
utility, and extract enough margin to support them. Currently in the 
California markets (PG&E, SDG&E, & SOCAL) , there exists approximately 50 
customers that have usages so low that given current market conditions, we 
will not choose to renew the contracts.  The expiration dates for these are 
between 5/30/2001 and 2/28/2005.

3) The customer initiates a request for termination prior to the end of their 
contractual expiration date.  As we are all aware, California customers, 
specifically those with either an index or NYMEX product, experienced a large 
swing in their pricing during the past few months.  CAD has been inundated 
with customers requesting to be returned to their LDC.  Although we seek to 
satisfy our customer to the best of our ability,  returning these customers 
to the utility is the LAST thing we want to do!!!!!!!  

The steps we have taken to address this issue is to:
 a) work with customer service/credit to offer extended payment options to 
ease the effect of the increase.
 b) offer to restructure the customer's contract, and reprice the customer on 
a fixed price product; minimizing their risk going forward.
 c) explain to the customer, in more detail, the reasons why this has 
occurred, and how, going forward, the index/NYMEX pricing has eased.  

Should you have additional questions, please reply or call.
-Jim

Subject: More Inquiries From CA PUC re: Switching customers back to LDC

Greetings:
 
Recall that about 3 weeks we got a call from a CA PUC staffer asking whether 
we'd switched a particular gas customer (or two) back to the LDC.  We looked 
into it and discovered that we'd mistakenly switched the customer back due to 
a mix up about the fact that the customer had two active meters behind two 
different utilities.  We informed the PUC staffer of the mix-up and explained 
that the situation would be resolved.  

The questions from the staffer arose because the CA PUC made a bad decision a 
couple of months ago. When gas prices ran up at the California border a lot 
of large (""noncore"") customers attempted to switch back to the utility tariff 
in the hope of lowering gas costs.  In response, SoCalGas filed with the 
Commission asking the PUC to prohibit customers from switching back.  The 
Commission agreed and put the prohibition in place.  The Commission is now 
concerned that if suppliers terminate their contracts with customers (for 
whatever reason), or choose not to renew the contracts when they expire, 
customers won't have the option of returning to LDC service.

Today, I received a letter from the President of the Commission asking me to 
respond to the following:

Have you ""stopped selling and delivering natural gas to any non-core 
customers with whom you have an existing procurement contract, or...notified 
any of your non-core customers that you do not intend to renew an existing 
natural gas commodity procurement contract.  If your company has stopped or 
intends to stop serving non-core customers, the CPUC also needs to know

how many contracts you have terminated or expect to terminate
the natural gas volumes involved
the location of the non-core customer(s)
the reason(s) your company intends or has already acted to terminate those 
contracts.""

There's a good chance that the letter from the President of the Commission is 
linked to the fact that we've recently switched our electricity customers 
back to utility service in California.  

Prior to deciding whether and how to respond to the Commissioner, I'm trying 
to get handle on whether we're re-sourcing any gas retail customers to the 
utility prior to expiration, choosing not to renew contracts once they've 
expired, etc.  Catherine, or Jim Foster, can you help out?  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

The continued growth of the new economy is threatened by our electricity

The high tech industry requires market driven solutions to reliability and

Here's an attempt at being frank about the legislation without jeopardizing 
our relationships or commercial prospects.

Overall, we respect the effort, but California failed to get the ball over 
the goal line:

On Siting
Intentionally or not, California has designed power plant siting laws that 
make it excruciatingly difficult to construct power plants in the state.  
Folks seem to have lost sight of the need to balance growth and environmental 
quality in California.
That's why nothing's been built in the state for a decade and developers are 
going outside the state to build power plants. 
Tinkering around the edges won't help; and (with all due respect) the 
legislation passed yesterday tinkers.
Real reform is required if California hopes to build the supply necessary to 
keep pace with Silicon Valley and a high tech culture and tame the price 
spikes.
If developers continue to have to navigate through a maze of a half a 
dozen--or more--state and local agencies, California's supply problems will 
continue, or worsen.
California needs real, one-stop shopping and it needs it now.

On the retail price cap
They don't work (we've already developed all the arguments, so I won't repeat 
them hear)
The press has already reported that the measure the Legislature passed simply 
puts off the day of reckoning.
It's like using your credit card--eventually they're going to knock on your 
door to collect.
Now, families and businesses will have a hard time managing their budgets 
because they can't gauge the size of the balloon payment they'll face a 
couple of years down the road.
So San Diegans who continue to take service from SDG&E will pay the same 
amount, but the cap will remove the powerful incentive prices create to use 
electricity wisely.
There's a better answer:
Instead of urging consumers not to switch, encourage customers to sign with 
another retail provider.  
Clearly, the biggest mistake California made was The press and decision 
makers should spend more time talking to folks who signed fixed price deals 
with companies like Enron.  But for the press reports, they hardly know 
there's a crisis.",enron_mail/maildir/dasovich-j/all_documents/1023,0,6,47,4,0,0,1,1,0,0,365,15,43,39,34,4.682191780821918,27,432,2141,153,234,0

""The Impact of Retail Rate Deregulation on Electricity Consumption in San 
Diego"" (April 2001) 
PWP-082 by James B. Bushnell and Erin T. Mansur
Retail electricity rates in the San Diego Gas & Electric service territory 
more than doubled over a period of three months during the summer of 2000. 
Much of this increase was subsequently rescinded through a retroactive rate 
freeze. We examine the impact of these events on overall consumption levels 
in San Diego. We find that average electricity consumption decreased by 
roughly 55 MW, or 1.6%, between mid-July and the end of August. Demand was 
reduced by over 6% in the late afternoon and late evening. Because of the 
uncertainty about the duration and the credibility of the rate increase, 
these results should be viewed as a lower bound on the demand reductions that 
could be achieved through pricing incentives.

********************************************

State Senate OKs bailing out Edison from bankruptcy 
Assembly plans own version for utility 
Lynda Gledhill and Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau 
Saturday, July 21, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle  
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/21/MN133267.DTL  
Sacramento -- The state Senate approved a plan yesterday to keep Southern California Edison from falling into bankruptcy, but the bill crafted as an alternative to the pact between the utility and Gov. Gray Davis faces an uncertain future. 
The bill by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of Palo Alto would give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $2.5 billion of the utility's debt. Edison amassed an estimated $3.5 billion in debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained frozen. 
The Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last night, but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of mistakes that led to California's botched 1996 deregulation legislation haunted lawmakers. 
Davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk before Aug. 15, a date set in the original agreement between Davis and Edison. 
Lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night, but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town. 
""It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess,"" Davis said of the Aug. 15 date. 
Davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to iron out differences between the two bills, but it is unclear whether that could be accomplished in the next few days. 
""I have problems with both bills,"" Davis said. ""I am heartened by the fact that there's a bill moving in each house."" 
Both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to a floor vote, and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the process. 
In the Senate, 22 Democrats voted for the Edison plan, while four Democrats and all 13 Republicans voted no. 
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she would vote for the bill in its current form, but not if any substantial changes are made. 
""The Legislature is ill-equipped to try to craft a deal,"" she said. ""This particular measure -- and only this one -- has the intent and clarity to protect ratepayers. I'm leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being cannibalized."" 
The Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue $2.5 billion in bonds to pay off alternative energy producers and their banks. The bonds would be paid off through increased rates charged Edison's largest customers and would not cover the $1 billion Edison owes out-of-state generators. 
Edison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy, which would put it back in the position of buying power. 
The state has been spending upward of $50 million a day on power since January, and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the utility can once again begin buying power. There is also hope that any deal would be used as a way to get Pacific Gas & Electric Co. out of bankruptcy. 
In the Assembly, two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change their bill. The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, was undergoing changes to garner more support. 
Some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines and taking municipal utilities out of the deal. 
Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D-San Jose, one of the undecided members on the Edison agreement, said the original bill was too complex. 
""It's a cleaner bill,"" Alquist said. ""I think it comes down to whether this does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG&E. I would say I'm tentatively satisfied."" 
Alquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature of the Edison negotiations. Only a few members of the Assembly -- all former state senators now in the lower house -- voted to approve the 1996 legislation, AB1890, that brought deregulation to California. 
Assemblyman Joseph Simitian, D-Palo Alto, said he gave a courtesy vote to the Hertzberg-Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee, in order to get the measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate. 
""As we've learned from the experience of AB1890, the devil is in the details. I have a lot of questions,"" Simitian said. ""The difficulty is that very little gets done here until there is a deadline, and then once there is a deadline, too much gets done."" 
Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was getting rushed, but he said lawmakers are well-informed about the energy crisis and its details. He said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings and countless hearings on the crisis. 
A wild card in the Assembly's plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D- Los Angeles, that garnered Republican support. The so-called ""straight bailout"" would give Edison its $3.5 billion through a $2-a-month fee levied on utility ratepayers. It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

Hi TJ:
Work has prevented me from being on campus this week.  I registered for 
1-unit courses, but have not ""signed up"" in the office.  If that is 
mandatory, please let me know and my girlfriend---a student in the day 
program who will be there today---can sign me up.

Best,

Hi,

ONE-UNIT COURSES:
The demand for one-unit courses is very high, as outlined in the Student 
Handbook.  It is uncommon for a student to be given a space in more than 
ONE one-unit course per semester.

If you got into your 1st choice of a 1-unit class for Fall 2001, you will 
not be put on a waitlist for your 2nd choice at this time.  After classes 
start in the Fall, if there is room available in any of the 1-units, we'll 
let you know.  Adds will be based on seniority in the program.

Thanks!
You'll be given a chance to update your schedules May 4 - May 11.
I will e-mail your Fall 2001 schedules to you this Friday.

Thanks!
TJ

Thanks, John.  Couple of things.  

First, I was involved with the analysis in point number one (i.e., if 
California had bought at 5 cents.....), but would be happy to discuss with 
those who worked on it.

Second, we've just about go the numbers scrubbed for #2 (working with Comnes 
and Tribolet on that analysis). Key to the ""back up"" on point number two will 
be internal sign off on releasing information that uses our curves as the 
benchmark in the mark to market assessment.  I'm checking with Steve Kean on 
that and will get back to you ASAP.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: Follow Up On California Information

Just following up on the Monday conference call discussion yesterday with 
Rick and others about nailing down the numbers and documentation so we can 
feed the Hill information on the mistakes Governor Davis made last year and 
this year on power supply contracts.

As I understand it, there are two aspects of this:

 1. The offer of Enron and others last year to sell power to California 
utilities for 5 cents per kw.  Failure to accept these offers resulted in 
higher power costs in the range of $15 billion, as I recall from yesterday's 
call.

 2. The long term contracts that California signed this year after taking 
actions and making statements that drove up the forward price curves are now 
under water to the tune of $20 billion.

On both counts we will be pressed for assumptions and documentation to pursue 
these arguments, which parallel the comments made by senior management in 
Capitol Hill meeting last week.  We will work on back up on this end, but we 
would greatly appreciate your assistance in this regard as well. 

With Congress out of session starting COB on Thursday, we will need 
information pulled together by tomorrow COB to get the final product in the 
hands of congressional types and others who can use it on a timely basis.  
Thanks.

Our messages are getting a little mixed.   So .. to that end, can we have a 
day or two to:  (1) figure out whether we want a reverse auction, competitive 
bidding for PLR, a GCIM-like mechanism? and (2) rationalize the various 
mechanisms if want it all.  

I'm confident that we can rationalize all of these mechanism--e.g, we can 
limit the percentage of load put up for auction, etc. if we put our minds to 
it.  However, we haven't done so yet.

The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very 
difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's 
going to be left dangling.

In the Senate:
The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of 
the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.
Burton announced during one of the two ""informational"" hearings that ""this is 
it,"" despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the 
committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.
The key features of the bill are:
Banks and QFs get paid in full.
Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers
No direct access.
There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill 
tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the 
Republicans will go along with it.

In the Assembly:
The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with 
Hertzberg's the likely winner.
That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the 
amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).
We're attempting to get the ""July 12"" date changed to ""the effective date of 
the bill"" or later.
The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the 
earliest.

The Problem:
The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each 
approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the 
night.
The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and 
Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.

The likely outcome given the circumstances:  
Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a ""fair"" bill); 
the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; 
they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.

That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit 
down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin 
talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given 
Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.

In short, little has changed since yesterday.

		 Subject: Rod Wright briefing

Assemblyman Rod Wright held another one of his informal discussions with
generators, IOUs and marketers.  This is what he said:

Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg is going to introduce a bill tomorrow
at 11:00 a.m. which will contain many of the same elements in ABX 1,
minus the 5.5.  This will be a more comprehensive bill which will
address arrearage, securitization and include some type of a stop loss
mechanism among other things.  It is unclear whether or not the bill
will be voted on tomorrow or held until Monday, but there will be a
hearing at 2:00 p.m.

SBX 1 will probably be heard tomorrow as well, although it is not clear
what action if any the Senate Energy Committee will take.

There are ongoing discussions about the state creating a transmission
corporation to operate but not own the transmission system.

There are ongoing discussions about allowing DWR to buy existing block
forward contracts, however the courts today issued a stay to prevent SCE
or the PX from taking any actions on the contracts until at least
February 2.

There are ongoing discussions about issuing ratepayer bonds in place of
the full faith and credit of the state which was absent from the DWR
RFB.

Sempra requested that the legislature repeal Utilities Code Section
355.2 which prevents IOUs from buying outside the PX.

Other items which arose today:

We spent the day meeting with legislators regarding expedited siting.
The response was positive, including from Senator Byron Sher who is the
key environmentalist in the legislature.  Our initial focus has been on
the trouble with getting air credits.

Governor Davis held a press conference moments ago where he indicated
that the average bid price for the DWR RFB is 6.9.   I will forward the
press release in the morning.

I have attached a press release from Governor Davis regarding the new
ISO board which includes information on the new members.

Jeff,

My name is Kurt Lindahl.  I recently joined Enron Global Markets on the LNG 
team.  I'm the Lead Developer for the West Coast and have been charged with 
building a (several) LNG terminal(s) on the west coast.  Michael McGarry, 
from Enron Engineering and Operational Services Company, is the lead 
Development Engineer on the project.

A key question in this effort is, ""Where is the best entry point into the 
Socal/SG&E/PG&E pipeline systems.  In other words, where can we site a LNG 
terminal and deliver natural gas into their systems, such that the amount of 
facilities they require is minimal?  I spoke with Ben Asante who heads up the 
optimization department in ETS.  He said that if we could get annual flow 
diagrams for the California intrastate systems, he could prepare a model in 
about 2 weeks time.  Interstate pipelines have to file Annual Flow Diagrams 
at FERC, but I'm not sure what Intrastates' are obligated to file with the 
CPUC?  That's where I need your help.  This is a hot subject, because the 
race to site an LNG terminal is intense.

Could you please call me at 713 345 5044 (O) or 713 515 2759 so that we can 
discuss.  We want to keep this effort very confidential, so please maintain 
secrecy.

I will also want to talk to you about permitting and state approvals.

Regards,

Kurt Lindahl

returning to SoCalGas when the contracts ends on 5/31?  If I've confused

		 Subject: Re: CPUC inquiry re gas customer turnbacks

	


Upon research, it was discovered that this customer has two active meters in 
two different Utilities (PG&E, and SOCAL) under the same contract.  This is 
the reason for the confusion.  For tracking purposes, we ""break-out"" meters 
by LDC in order to assign our customers to reps familiar with a particular 
LDC. Those customers that have multiple LDC's under the same contract are 
assigned to the same rep.  This allows the customers to speak to the same 
individual for all of their accounts.

Unfortunately the site in question was identified in error as a single site 
only.  The site in PG&E was assigned to Dennis Harris, while the site in 
SOCAL, because of the low usage, was identified for transition to SOCAL.  
This was not our intention.  The data has been realigned and Dennis Harris 
now has access to both records.  

I spoke to Dennis regarding this issue, and he will contact the customer, 
explain why it occurred, stop the transition to SOCAL for this site, should 
the customer choose to; as well as coordinate a renewal for this customer 
going forward, as their current agreement is to expire 05/31/01.

Greetings Jess:
I work in Government Affairs in San Francisco.  I would like to discuss 
internally and think hard about this before we give any response to the 
staffer at the CPUC---not because we have any reason not to respond, but 
because this a problem created almost exclusively by the PUC, and I don't 
want to give the PUC the opportunity to shift bad decision making and actions 
onto us.  There's a very easy fix to the situation.  The Commission can 
reverse the bad decision it made a month or so ago, and permit customers to 
return to utility service.

I've forwarded all of the information to Catherine Woods and Roger Ponce.  
Let's discuss more internally when we've gathered up all the facts and then 
decide whether and how we choose to respond to the staffer at the PUC.  My

		 Subject: RE: CPUC inquiry re gas customer turnbacks

Jess, there is little more than I indicated in my note.  
I received a phone call from Sarita Sarvate, an analyst at the Energy
Division of the CPUC asking why we were returning gas customers to utility
service, citing ""a number of customer complaints, including a school and a
hospital"".  It now turns out that the school and the hospital are from the
same customer essentially.  The CPUC staff recognizes that they have no
direct jurisdiction over gas sales, but are concerned about the effect of
turnbacks on their utility regulation, as they are in the process of
eliminating the core subscription program which allows noncore customers to
take core service.  In fact there is now a resolution in place barring
noncore customers from taking core subscrition service from SoCalGas or
SDG&E.  They want to know if this is part of a trend which they will have to
adapt to or whether it is an isolated incident.  In addition, they would
like to be able to offer the customer some options for continuing gas
service.  

Let me know if I can add any more or if you can assist us in responding to
the CPUC. 

Thanks, Mike Day

has a biz meeting in D.C. on the 13th, which makes having a meeting in San

Two things:  When Aleck said that he was leaving ""effective immediately,"" does that mean one can't use email to send him a note to wish him well?  If that's the case, do we have a forwarding telephone number for him?

Also, just wanted to make sure you're aware that Calger continues to express concerns about us having any fingerprints on any attacks on the contracts.  His concerns are two-fold:  Generally, he thinks it would be very damaging to our commercial reputation, since many of the folks holding the lousy contracts are folks we regularly transact with. And specifically, we're tied up with Allegheny (sp?).  

I've told him that we don't like the contracts, that we're talking to folks about how bad they are, but we're ""staying under radar"" and stating publicly that we never support the unilateral abrogation of anyone's contract rights.",enron_mail/maildir/dasovich-j/sent_items/270,14,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,152,4,5,11,10,4.407894736842105,15,183,853,76,108,0

Thanks, Harry.  I want to re-enforce the switching issue, since EES is likely 
to be very focused on moving customers back to the utility on Tuesday.  
Switching would certainly reduce EES' going-forward exposure to 1) growing 
""credit receivables"" that the utilities refuse to pay and 2) the risk that 
the Commission will end the rate freeze altogether---and the PX credit with 
it--as part of the hearing process that commences with the pre-hearing 
conference on Wednesday.  Reducing that exposure is clealry important to EES.

But the utilities' ability to resist taking back customers is likely to be 
significant, particularly since 90% of the volumes that we serve are on Enron 
meters.  Imagine the road blocks that the utility can/will construct over the 
""complex process""  of changing-out the meters.  In addition, when CA border 
gas prices spiked several weeks ago, many large gas customers tried to switch 
from noncore to core service on SoCalGas' system.  SoCalGas submitted an 
emergency motion at the Commission to prevent the switching and the 
Commission granted it in the wink of an eye.

It will be important for EES to drill down fairly deeply in its analysis of 
all the ways that the utility can frustrate any switching.  Otherwise, we may 
find ourselves confronting a lot of negative PR without having reduced any of 
EES' exposure.  Customers who have been unwillingly switched back to the 
utility have become very vocal about their displeasure and have turned 
negative on ESPs as a result.

Best,
Jeff

These 3 issues will be discussed at your Tuesday afternoon meeting with EES:

what to do about forcing the utilities to pay delinquent PX credits
Through December, the total arrearage is about $220M total, mostly from 
PG&E.  Neither utility is paying.  Vicki Sharpe is lining up bankruptcy 
counsel.

should the new 1 cent surcharge be passed on to our customers
Vicki has not said yet whether our contracts allow passthrough, although she 
has hinted it would require a very aggressive interpretation of the contract.
 
should we try to return our customers to utility bundled service
Aside from the modifications to our customer contracts that have to take 
place, an even stickier issue is to get the utilities to take them back.  
Even if the utilities are required to do so, forms have to be processed and 
meters have to be changed out.  (We have our own meters on our accounts.)  
This could not happen quickly.  Of course, this action mitigates against the 
risk of the rate freeze ending but does nothing for the credit problem, other 
than to keep the exposure from getting larger.

On Wednesday, there will be a pre-hearing conference at the CPUC on the next 
phase of the end-the-rate-freeze case.  Jeff and I have talked about this and 
think we can decide what our involvement will be (witnesses, positions, etc.) 
after a schedule is set.  For now, the strategy is to make sure the CPUC on 
Wednesday adopts a schedule that deals with all the issues they must deal 
with about the rate freeze. 

(Rick, I will be in San Francisco through Wednesday meeting with Mike Day and 
working with Roger Yang to identify all those issues.)

Just got off the call with the California stakeholders. The group's trying to 
come up with a solution and today's call was a challenge.  Edison threw new 
demands on the table that effectively ended any chance for a deal today.  

Appears that at this point that anything more than a 10% rate increase is out 
of the question politically for the Governor, and the utilities are very 
unhappy about it.  Consumer groups are already balking publicly at the 10% 
increase reported in the press.

The meeting effectively ended when Edison announced that, in response to New 
West turning back their customers, Edison plans to file a proposal with the 
Commission this week that would require all returning customers to pay the 
spot price for energy.  The large customer groups blew their tops and that 
pretty much ended the call.

The group agreed to meet again on Friday, after the PUC business meeting on 
Thursday.

 Commissioners Henry M. Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting:

One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.

We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. 

Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. 

	DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  

	We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. 

For these reasons we must respectfully dissent.

Let's try this.  Neither of us will say one critical thing of the other.  I 
won't say anything, in jest, or otherwise, and you do the same.  And if 
someone does, the other needs to bring it up. But Prentice, if I say, ""that's 
critical"" and then I have to have a long argument about the fact that I think 
it is, and you think it isn't, that isn't going to work.  So I'm willing to 
have a complete moratorium, if that's something that you're willing to try, 
too.

I hope you'll going sailing today.  Did I leave my sunglasses in your car?  I

Jeff, I love you, but I'm unhappy.  I just don't want to be criticized
anymore.  The thing is, I know you think a lot of it is funny, and I've just
lost my sense of humor, but the truth is, after a while, it's just not funny
anymore.  Like when you yawned last night when I was telling a story to your
friends.  Yes, it's funny.  But when you do it every time, after a while, it
just starts to hurt my feelings.  That's just one recent example.  You're
often telling everybody how neurotic and fucked up I am.  Or how I'm totally
overbearing about playing the banjo.  In fact, you just said that today to
my friends at Haas.  Do you know how embarassing that was for me?  You
should listen to yourself when you talk about me in front of your friends or
my friends or my family.  How often do you say nice things and how often do
you criticize me?  Why don't you ask them and see what they have to say.
I've tried to talk to you about it.  I asked you to spend some time trying
to say mostly nice things, just for a little while.  But apparantly, you
either can't or won't, and the end result is that I feel like you just don't
care.  I'm sure there are things you want me to do.  I'd like to try to do
them.  But I don't know what else I can do to make you understand that I
just can't take all the criticism from you anymore.  It makes me feel like
shit.  I don't know where else to go, Jeff.  I suggested talking to a
shrink, but you're not willing to do that either.  I'm sure that half of it
is my fault, and I'd like to work on this together, but you don't seem to be
willing to work on the one thing that's really hurting me and that I've
asked you to work on.  And maybe that means you need to think about how you
really feel.

In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding ""litigation.""  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
Any ""overcollection"" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called ""undercollection"")
If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change
If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)
The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure
Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the ""filed rate doctrine"" and 2) the so-called ""TURN"" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
Edison agrees to ""cooperate"" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the ""special"" session that the Governor recently announced

We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

Gouger Gray Davis 
California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity

LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San 
Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute.
On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with 
regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nice 
publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been 
unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this 
optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument that 
out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has 
been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private 
generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this 
amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation between 
state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's 
chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge 
overcharge ""has not and cannot be substantiated."" Further, while the 
generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state, 
perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the 
state than they owe the state in refunds: ""Can a cash refund be required 
where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not."" 
Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a ""raw deal"" and by urging 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and 
the judge's conclusions and to ""step up and provide the refunds we've asked 
for."" Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed, 
Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a 
""melodramatic virtual world"" de-linked from reality. 
Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly 
released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power 
companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the 
average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year. 
California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District 
(SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state 
generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping 
boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330 
per megawatt hour. 
Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis 
spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at ""the generators 
who wear cowboy hats"" and that ""just because there are other entities that 
are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off 
by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."" 
Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it 
turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business 
consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion in 
ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The 
state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the 
current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state 
power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high prices 
are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set to 
eliminate ""direct access,"" which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power. 
Who's the real gouger? No matter how much Davis points the finger, 
Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad 
policies. ",enron_mail/maildir/dasovich-j/all_documents/29321,4,4,20,3,0,1,11,11,0,0,608,28,54,104,84,4.9506578947368425,63,749,3759,231,333,11

Thanks Harry.  This is important and we've discussed making sure that Neil 
and Jubran (and you, for that matter) be included in any distribution that 
includes ENA West.  Consider it done.  Unless others have any problems, I 
suggest that going forward any emails, materials, phone conversations, etc. 
that include ENA also include EES.  I don't think that we have any legal 
issues associated with including both ENA and EES, but if I'm missing 
something, please let me know.  Thoughts?

The Governor's office wants more information about what the meeting would

In response, Tyson and her very able helper are taking the 1.5-pager that I

They will forward it to me as soon as they've got it drafted.

business face cards to assist in getting the business community to the

PUC considers rewarding producers that sign long-term contracts 
Greg Lucas, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Wednesday, March 21, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

N33580.DTL 
Sacramento -- Some cash-strapped producers of wind, solar and other 
alternative forms of energy will get long-delayed financial relief under a 
proposed order by state regulators, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday evening. 
A proposed order by the Public Utilities Commission is designed to reward 
energy producers who sign long-term contracts with utilities at lower rates. 
Alternative energy producers that voluntarily enter such contracts, which 
would start on April 1, would be paid within 15 days, said Davis, who 
requested the order. Those that do not would have to wait until the utilities 
that buy their power return to solvency. 
Davis blasted Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison for 
not paying the alternative generators -- know as qualified facilities, or 
""QFs"" -- even though the companies have been collecting money through rates. 
""It is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the 
money designed to compensate the QFs,"" Davis said. ""It's immoral and has to 
stop."" 
Alternative producers -- ranging from massive co-generation facilities at oil 
refineries to tiny biomass plants -- produce about a third of the state's 
supply of electricity. But many are shutting down because utilities have not 
paid them since November. 
The loss of some 3,000 megawatts from tapped-out alternative energy producers 
contributed to the blackouts that snarled California yesterday and Monday, 
according to the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power 
grid. 
The PUC's proposed order -- which will be considered at the board's Tuesday 
meeting -- offers the generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract 
at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. 
The order does not address the more than $1 billion already owed to the more 
than 600 alternative energy producers around the state. Davis said to favor 
one creditor over another in past debt could bring on bankruptcy proceedings 
from other creditors. 
The Legislature would also need to act to make the order work. 
""It is critical to keep these facilities up and online,"" said Sen. Debra 
Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, who estimates that Edison has $1.5 billion in cash 
on hand, and PG&E $2.5 billion. ""The utilities owe it to the people of the 
state to pay them."" 
Edison said yesterday that it opposed any attempt to place alternative 
producers ahead of their other creditors. 
But Tom Higgins, a senior vice president for Edison International, which owes 
alternative producers some $835 million, said his company was talking to the 
governor's office about possible payment structures. 
Alternative energy producers, particularly those that use high-priced natural 
gas to fire their generators, say that without an immediate infusion of cash 
they must close their plants. 
""We've been obsessed with the health of the utilities and (have) forgotten 
the health of everyone else,"" said V. John White, legislative director of the 
Clean Power Campaign, which lobbies for alternative energy producers. 
CalEnergy Operating Corp., which operates eight geothermal plants in the 
Imperial Valley producing 268 megawatt hours for Edison has sued the utility 
asking to be paid and to be temporarily released from their contract with 
Edison which has paid them nothing since November. 
CalEnergy has a court hearing tomorrow on its Edison contract. Edison owes 
the company $75 million, and the debt increases by $1 million a day. 
""We've lived up to our end of the bargain but Edison hasn't. We're now not in 
a position to make a property tax payment on April 10 and we're the largest 
employer in the county,"" said Vince Signorotti, CalEnergy's property manager. 
Unlike Edison, PG&E is paying its creditors 15 cents on the dollar. 
""We have offered over the past five days to prepay for future power not yet 
delivered to keep as many of them operating as possible, but the state needs 
to decide how its going to divvy up the limited money under the frozen 
rates,"" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. 
The PUC's sudden attempt to recast the rates paid to alternative generators 
comes after several months of inaction, partly a result of waiting for 
legislative negotiations on the issue to conclude. Those negotiations 
eventually failed to move forward.

Enron to cut one-fifth of jobs at broadband unit.

04/06/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

HOUSTON, April 6 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Friday 
it will eliminate some 250, or roughly 20 percent, of the jobs at its 
broadband telecommunications unit, detailing a move which it has previously 
described as an internal redeployment of staff. 
Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly said the company is 
cutting jobs at the unit, which now employs 1,150 people, because it has 
completed the build-out of its 18,000-mile (29,000 km) fiber-optic network 
and because of slow demand for streaming media products delivered to personal 
computers.
""The network is substantially complete now, so that means fewer people are 
required for technical positions,"" she said. 
The job cuts also reflect Enron Broadband's decision to play a less active 
role in the market for streaming media services, such as video of corporate 
events delivered to personal computers, where demand had been slower than 
expected, she said. 
However, Kimberly said Enron Broadband will continue to pursue 
entertainment-on-demand services actively. 
Kimberly said employees whose jobs are being eliminated will be eligible for 
redeployment to other positions at Enron Broadband Services or other Enron 
units, although there could be some involuntary terminations. 
Previously Enron officials had dismissed rumors about job cuts at Enron 
Broadband Services and had spoken instead of an internal redeployment of 
staff within the unit without detailing its impact on overall employment 
there. 
The company's stock, which peaked at just above $90 last year and was trading 
in the $80s as recently as mid-February, has recently fallen into the $50s in 
line with broader weakness in the stock market and among technology and 
telecommunications stocks in particular. On Friday it was up 95 cents at 
$56.65. 
Since early last year Enron has been building a high-speed broadband 
communications network that it plans to use as a base to build a bandwidth 
marketing and trading business similar to its huge natural gas and 
electricity trading operation. 
Excitement among investors about the broadband business and about Enron's 
success in developing a strong Internet-based trading platform for energy and 
other commodities drove an 87 percent rise in the company's share price last 
year, outpacing a gain of 54 percent for the S&P utilities index. 
Kimberly said Enron's bandwidth trading operation is continuing to perform 
strongly, with more than 500 trades carried out in the first quarter, 
exceeding the total for all of 2000. 
Despite the jobs cuts at Enron Broadband, she said, the unit is recruiting to 
fill some other positions.

	Calif GOP Lawmakers Ask PUC President To Resign 
	
	
	Updated: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 02:14 PM?ET 
	
	? 
	?
	
	
	
	
	LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Assembly Republicans have called for the 
resignation of Loretta Lynch, president of the state's Public Utilities 
Commission, saying they have no confidence that the state's top regulator 
will ""play a constructive role in solving the state's energy crisis."" 
	Assembly Republican Minority Leader Bill Campbell, R-Villa Park, sent a 
letter Tuesday to Gov. Gray Davis on behalf of the Assembly's Republican 
Caucus asking Davis to call for Lynch's resignation. 
	
	
	?
	""With efforts to solve California's energy crisis floundering in the midst of 
unpaid bills, stalled negotiations and rolling blackouts, it has come time to 
ask for the resignation of your appointed president of the California Public 
Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch,"" the letter said. 
	Both Lynch and a spokesman for Davis were unavailable for comment. 
	Lynch, a former attorney, was appointed president of the PUC by Davis in 
March 2000. She is the state's top regulator, in charge of regulating 
utilities, telecommunications, commercial transportation and water companies. 
Before her appointment to the PUC, Lynch was head of Davis's office of 
Planning and Research. 
	The letter says the PUC had a number of opportunities last summer to keep the 
electricity crisis from spiraling out of control by allowing Edison 
International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. 
(PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Sempra Energy (SRE, news, 
msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric to sign long-term power supply contracts 
for about $50 a megawatt-hour, nearly $30 lower than the new long-term 
contracts Davis said the state entered into recently with generators. 
	Lynch's failure to ""ensure that the commission's Aug. 3, 2000, emergency 
order on long-term contracts was quickly implemented has placed the state 
budget at risk for costs now at least 40% higher,"" the letter said. ""This 
hesitancy in a crisis will cost California's economy tens of billions of 
dollars during the next 20 years."" 
	The state has spent more than $3 billion since January buying power in the 
spot market. Davis has asked lawmakers for another $500 million from the 
general fund to continue buying power. If the $500 million is granted, the 
state's commitment to power purchases will surpass $4 billion. 
	State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, however, said last week that the Senate 
Budget Committee will deny further requests for funding unless the PUC carves 
out a revenue stream for the state's Department of Water Resources, the 
agency that is now buying the bulk of the state's power on behalf of the 
cash-strapped utilities. 
	The PUC was expected to release guidelines last week on rates the DWR can 
receive from utilities to pay back the general fund and to issue revenue 
bonds to pay for long-term contracts. But the guidelines haven't yet been 
released. 
	Last year, the PUC said the utilities could enter into limited long-term 
supply contracts to hedge their positions against price spikes. But the 
commission also said it feared if the utilities signed long-term deals with 
generators, liquidity in the wholesale market would be reduced. 
	The Republican lawmakers said the commission is responsible for nearly 
forcing the utilities into bankruptcy. 
	""We have no confidence that Loretta Lynch will play a constructive role in 
solving the energy crisis in the weeks and months ahead,"" the letter said. 
""With Wall Street nervous about repayment of the $10 billion in revenue bonds 
needed to cover the state's energy purchases, the CPUC has been unable to 
perform an adequate assessment of the investor-owned utilities' financial 
situation.""

This pretty much summarizes the events over the weekend resulting from PG&E's 
filing on Monday--more stellar leadership from the administration.
Biggest news is that the Governor is now frantically trying to cobble 
together a Tx buy-out deal with Edison & Sempra; but note that Burton in this 
story questions whether it makes sense to buy Tx if PG&E isn't part of the 
deal.
The first hearing on the bankruptcy is today.

Governor, Utility In War Of Words 
Davis furious as PG&E defends bankruptcy filing

N223519.DTL 
California's energy mess took an ugly turn yesterday as Gov. Gray Davis and 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. traded barbs over who is to blame for the 
bankruptcy of the state's largest utility. 
In a series of tit-for-tat statements, each side laid claim to the moral high 
ground while insisting that the other had been dealing in bad faith. 
The governor spent part of his time yesterday giving television interviews in 
response to The Chronicle's report Saturday that PG&E awarded $50 million in 
bonuses and raises to 6,000 employees just hours before Friday's bankruptcy 
filing. 
""PG&E's management is suffering from two afflictions: denial and greed,"" 
Davis said in a brief statement Saturday night. 
In a testy reply, PG&E countered that ""instead of focusing all his attention 
on solving the state's yearlong and ever-worsening energy crisis, the 
governor has launched a campaign-style attack on our company."" 
PG&E said Davis was criticizing ""thousands of men and women who have worked 
tirelessly and professionally through this crisis"" and concluded that 
""California would be far better served if the governor turned his attention 
to the crisis at hand."" 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, fired back yesterday: ""PG&E 
waged a public relations war on Friday. If they're looking for somebody to 
blame, they should look in the mirror."" 
Maviglio also said the governor was concentrating on reaching a final accord 
with Southern California Edison Co. for the state to purchase the cash- 
strapped company's power lines for nearly $2.8 billion. 
A last round of talks was scheduled to be held last night. 
""There are a few remaining details to be worked out, but it seems pretty 
close,"" Maviglio said, adding that an announcement of the deal could come as 
early as today. 
""The governor is spending his time negotiating with a responsible utility,"" 
he said. 
Along with the Edison deal, Davis spent the weekend huddling with energy 
advisers and lawyers trying to come up with an appropriate response to PG&E's 
bankruptcy bombshell. 
Efforts to stabilize California's dysfunctional electricity market suddenly 
have become much more complex. 
NOT MUCH CHANGED
Nevertheless, while PG&E's bankruptcy is by far the most sensational aspect 
of California's long-drawn-out energy mess, at the end of the day, it doesn't 
really change a thing. 
Consider: 
-- PG&E's financial woes stem from a rate freeze that prevented the utility 
from passing along to customers runaway wholesale power costs. That rate 
freeze and sky-high electricity prices remain in place. 
-- California's energy shortage is primarily the result of the state not 
having built any major power plants for the past 12 years. PG&E's bankruptcy 
does nothing to affect that precarious situation. 
-- PG&E's foray into bankruptcy court does not alter the fact that 
electricity demand is outpacing available supply. California consumers still 
face a threat of daily blackouts when power usage spikes this summer. 
""The crux of the problem is still the same,"" said Loretta Lynch, president of 
the state Public Utilities Commission. ""We face the same challenges we did 
before PG&E filed for bankruptcy."" 
She added, however, that PG&E's bankruptcy ""increases the uncertainty."" 
The utility doesn't see it that way. 
PG&E spokesman Ron Low said California's energy woes are no more uncertain 
now than they were when the company ostensibly was negotiating with Davis to 
find an equitable solution to the state's troubles. 
""California remains in an energy crisis,"" he said. ""As we head toward summer, 
resources are going to be very tight."" 
WHAT COULD HAPPEN
In the short run, consumers will notice no change whatsoever. Bankruptcy 
protection will allow PG&E to continue operating as usual while the company's 
creditors line up to receive at least partial payment of outstanding bills. 
Longer term, there is a very real possibility that electricity rates will 
soar if the bankruptcy judge agrees with PG&E that conditions for lifting the 
rate freeze were met a year ago and that $9 billion in subsequent expenses 
must be borne by consumers. 
How much people's bills would rise depends on how the rate increase is 
structured. It would probably come in the form of a surcharge on existing 
fees, 
but the monthly hit to consumers could be limited by spreading the total cost 
over a number of years. 
The big question mark now is how PG&E's bankruptcy will affect various 
political and legislative measures intended to keep California's lights on. 
The state's attempt to purchase PG&E's power lines is obviously finished, 
although a new deal could be negotiated in bankruptcy court. 
Meanwhile, the governor is pressing ahead with plans to purchase the 
transmission systems of Edison and Sempra Energy's San Diego utility -- 
although what the state would do with only a partial power grid has yet to be 
determined. 
""Does it make any sense to have the transmission lines of Edison and Sempra 
and not PG&E?"" asked state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San 
Francisco. ""I don't know the answer to that."" 
A final accord with Edison this week would validate PG&E's apparent concerns 
that it would have had a harder time limiting backlash to its bankruptcy 
filing if the utility had acted after a breakthrough with Edison was 
unveiled. 
The Chronicle quoted PG&E insiders yesterday as saying that the decision to 
file for bankruptcy had been made early last week, even though senior company 
officials said the move followed the governor's Thursday night speech on 
solving California's energy issues. 
One reason PG&E opted to file on Friday morning was because a final deal with 
Edison was expected at any time, observers said. 
Paul Patterson, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, noted that if PG&E 
had filed for bankruptcy after Edison came to terms with the state, ""they 
would be seen as a spoiler."" 
ENSUING CONFUSION
In any case, PG&E's surprise filing has left all concerned scrambling for 
footing in the changed political landscape. 
Consumer advocates watched with dismay yesterday as the state's political and 
corporate powers slugged it out for supremacy. 
Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San 
Francisco, said all this finger-pointing will do nothing to ensure that 
Californians have ample supplies of electricity this summer. 
""These guys should grow up and come up with a situation that works for the 
public,"" she said.

Got a call from Dynegy.  Culled the following:

Bankruptcy
Dynegy will be fighting for a seat at the creditor table, since PG&E's filing 
failed (said Dynegy) to include a substantial amount of Dynegy receivables 
stemming from gas sales.

Legislative investigation into wholesale power markets
The request they received from the legislative committee (Dunn?) looking into 
wholesale prices included 86 questions, including:
Every bid made into ISO/PX markets since day 1.
Every document showing every forecast of energy prices done by the company.
Every document regarding bids for utility power plants leading up to 
divestiture.
Every document regarding communications with any other generator/trade 
association.

In a meeting with Dunn last week, he told Dynegy that the committee will 
thoroughly investigate whether there's been market manipulation.  If there's 
been none, no one has anything to worry about, and the committee would then 
move on to examine whether ""the market is dysfunctional.""

The first hearings (this Wednesday and next) will examine all of the other 
investigations currently underway (e.g., CPUC, ISO, FERC, class action suit, 
AG (uncertain).

The generators will be up first (on the 25th, as it currently stands), 
followed by marketers, followed by the munis.

The committee is requesting that the generators send their CEOs---rumors 
(perhaps far-fetched) that the committee wants to set it up like the

Subject:	[PRESSLIST] ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL LOCKYER ISSUES STATEMENT IN 
RESPONSE TO PG&E DECISION TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY
ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL LOCKYER ISSUES STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO PG&E DECISION 
TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY

(SACRAMENTO) - Attorney General Bill Locker today released the following 
statement regarding Pacific Gas & Electric's decision to file for bankruptcy:

""The uncontrolled increase in electricity prices by generators and marketers 
has claimed another victim with the bankruptcy of one of California's oldest 
businesses. While this is a significant and unwelcome development, our team 
of bankruptcy litigators has been
preparing for several months to defend California taxpayers in the event of a 
utility bankruptcy. This morning, I spoke with a PG&E executive, and he 
personally assured me that the utility will honor its legal obligation to pay 
the state for its purchase of energy and
to repay its renewable energy supplier-creditors (""qualified facilities""). I 
am prepared to enforce those assurances in the courts to the extent 
necessary. Over the last several months, our state attorneys have fought hard 
in the courts to ensure that out-of-state
generators continue to deliver adequate electricity and natural gas supplies 
to Californians in spite of the precarious financial condition of the state's 
two major utilities. The health and safety of Californians and the future of 
our economy require that our state not be left holding the bag for greedy 
business decisions of generators, marketers and utilities. Justice requires 
that those who have reaped unconscionable profits at the expense of 
Californians must pay back what they owe. I will use all the considerable 
resources of the law to help our policymakers keep the lights on and the 
bills affordable for every California home and business, to recover 
California tax and ratepayer dollars that have been illegally or unfairly 
taken, and to punish wrongdoers.""

AWARD TO INFORMANTS

""It is possible that one or more members of the public can help with 
information, and if so, the financial reward to such a person or persons 
could be enormous. My office is conducting an aggressive investigation into 
whether energy providers have violated any laws. Over the last four years, 
state and local government agencies have spent billions of dollars in state 
and local taxpayer money to purchase electricity and natural gas. Under 
California false claims law, any person or corporation who obtains state 
taxpayer money by fraud or illegal acts is liable for financial penalties 
that can be as high as three times the actual losses. And anyone who provides 
information leading to the successful prosecution of a false claim action may 
be entitled to a percentage share in that award. Since billions of state 
dollars may be recovered, the award to an informant could potentially range 
from $50 million to the
hundreds of millions of dollars. I am asking any member of the public with 
personal knowledge of any wrongful act which may have resulted in reduction 
in the California supplies or increase in the price of natural gas or 
electricity to contact my office immediately by calling: 1-800-952-5225 (w/in

Thanks Madeleine.  What a great picture and so perfect for Lari to marry on
horseback!

Here's the tally for the weekend of Sept. 23 and preferred riding schedules:

Cal and me -- at least Sat and Sun, prefer 1/2 day ride each day, one on
beach, one in forest, but also okay with one full day forest (Sat) and half
day beach (Sun).
Madeleine  -- all day Sat. and 1/2 day Sun.
Pippa Murray -- interested (not sure of her riding preference).
Pat -- interested but cannot commit until the date is closer.
Nora -- interested in a 1/2 day ride but cannot commit until date is closer.
Not interested in ""man from snowy river"" route.
Alice -- can't make it.

I have not heard from the others.  Anyone else want to join?

Accommodations:   Because of the uncertain numbers, it looks like getting a
house to rent would not work.  As for B&B or hotel accommodations, I think I
might prefer being closer to Fort Bragg than Howard Creek Ranch.  It might
make sense to reserve rooms at a couple of places and decide later when
we've heard more definitively from the group....  I'll scout around this
week and see what's still available, and let you all know.

Riding:  Based on the above, unless someone tells me differently today, I'll
tell the ranch we have five people for an all-day Sat (Cal, me, Madeleine,
Pippa, Pat), and six for half-day Sunday (same plus Nora).  We can always
cancel later if we have to.

Tally ho!

Amy

The Hearings
The hearings have transitioned to the more traditional, courtroom-like 
environment, with lawyers engaged in detailed cross-examination of utility 
witnesses.
The hearing focused solely on the utility claims of financial hardship.
The hearings went from 9AM-5PM and only managed to make it through two PG&E 
witnesses--extensive, detailed questions on PG&E's cash management practices 
since restructuring started in 1998.
Questions to witnesses focused in particular on PG&E's use of cash for 
investment and financing activities over the past 2-3 years (e.g., 
dividend/stock repurchase activities, transfer of cash from IOU to parent and 
parent's use of that cash for investment activities).  
Questions also focused on options other than rate increases available to the 
utility (e.g., liquidate certain assets of unregulated biz units, loans from 
parent, bankruptcy).
The commissioners and the ALJ have reacted in extremely hostile manner toward 
PG&E's repeated attempts to amend and add to their proposal as the hearings 
progress.
Questioning of PG&E witnesses will continue at 10 AM on Tuesday, followed by 
Edison witness.
Unclear when the hearings will end, though the Commission is scheduled to 
issue its decision on Thursday.
At this point, it seems very unlikely that the Commission will have developed 
the record necessary to do anything other than raise rates under its general 
ratemaking authority.

Outside the Hearing
Intense negotiations between Governor's office and utility management 
continue.
Seems that the Commission/Administration is beating up on the utilities 
inside the hearing room in an attempt to soften the utilities up and gain 
some leverage in the negotiations taking place outside the hearing room.
Governor continues to try to bring consumer groups into the negotiations with 
utilities, but consumer groups continue to resist and continue to oppose any 
rate increases.
Governor seems to be attempting to set up a situation where the Commission 
absorbs the political heat for raising rates on the 4th, and the Governor 
follows-up with a more comprehensive set of proposals as part of his state of 
the state speech on the 8th.",enron_mail/maildir/kean-s/discussion_threads/5429,5,6,41,7,1,2,1,1,80,80,350,17,39,54,27,5.085714285714285,30,409,2189,137,194,12

Well, he launched today.  Have you seen the materials from the press 
conference that he launched today?  I think this is actually a good 
thing--makes our proposal look like a much more preferable alternative by 
comparison, makes our support in the process more important, and sets Harvey 
up as the Ralph Nader equivalent in the election to fix California's broken 
system---a potential spoiler.",enron_mail/maildir/dasovich-j/all_documents/3934,6,3,26,3,0,0,1,1,0,0,66,2,6,7,6,4.803030303030303,6,82,399,27,53,0

Got a call from Dynegy.  Culled the following:

Bankruptcy
Dynegy will be fighting for a seat at the creditor table, since PG&E's filing 
failed (said Dynegy) to include a substantial amount of Dynegy receivables 
stemming from gas sales.

Legislative investigation into wholesale power markets
The request they received from the legislative committee (Dunn?) looking into 
wholesale prices included 86 questions, including:
Every bid made into ISO/PX markets since day 1.
Every document showing every forecast of energy prices done by the company.
Every document regarding bids for utility power plants leading up to 
divestiture.
Every document regarding communications with any other generator/trade 
association.

In a meeting with Dunn last week, he told Dynegy that the committee will 
thoroughly investigate whether there's been market manipulation.  If there's 
been none, no one has anything to worry about, and the committee would then 
move on to examine whether ""the market is dysfunctional.""

The first hearings (this Wednesday and next) will examine all of the other 
investigations currently underway (e.g., CPUC, ISO, FERC, class action suit, 
AG (uncertain).

The generators will be up first (on the 25th, as it currently stands), 
followed by marketers, followed by the munis.

The committee is requesting that the generators send their CEOs---rumors 
(perhaps far-fetched) that the committee wants to set it up like the 
congressional tobacco hearings.",enron_mail/maildir/kean-s/all_documents/5268,7,5,54,4,0,2,13,11,0,0,228,13,32,46,23,5.166666666666667,27,294,1472,79,150,5

Anything can happen, but Hedy just talked to the Executive Offficer of the Senate Rules committee who told her that it is very unlikely that the full Senate would vote on any contempt report before the Senate leaves for recess; that is, they likely wouldn't vote on anything until they return in August.

Other info from the conversation:
With respect to fines, sanctions, etc., he said that ""they're making it up as they go.""

The state treasurer sent a letter this afternoon to Loretta Lynch.
The treasurer claims in the letter that, by extending DA  through Sept. 20th, the PUC could have shifted more than $8 billion to small customers.
He urges Lynch to immediately roll back the date to July 1.
We have started working with large customers to refute the letter.

the power contracts offered to the IOUs, only the offers accepted by PG&E and

offers accepted.  However, I'm fairly confident that I can dig deeper and get

S&P threatened publicly yesterday that unless the PUC acts decisively today 
to fix the utilities' cash flow issue, they will significantly downgrade 
California's IOUs.  I assume that's in the WSJ article Rick referenced.  As

Jeff - instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 %, I think 
we should acknowledge that a ""modest"" increase may be necessary and may in 
fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be 
reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings, not just 
determined by whim.  In general, we should not be overly prescriptive at this 
point and I know you agree with that.  Otherwise, I think you have captured 
the points excellently.

If time permits, we can also have a substantive discussion of the issues.  In 
this regard, if its ready, we can present an overview of the California 
strategy that is being developed (initially) by Sandi and Jeff.

FYI--  Despite strong urging, TURN did NOT join in the press conference or

no choice but to do so in the future, depending upon how FERC, the 
Governor, the Legislature and the CPUC react to the unfolding crisis.  For 
now, we will continue to work for reasonable regulatory and legislative 
solutions that protect small ratepayers from the consequences of a debacle 
that they never asked for or wanted.   I am plannning to attend Friday's

Allan Zaremberg, President of the California Chamber of Commerce, met
with John Burton to discuss energy.  One of the items which John Burton
brought up to Allan was Bob Hertzberg's core/non-core proposal.
According to the Chamber, Burton is interested in the concept and wants
to get Allan's thoughts.  The Chamber is very interested in hearing more
about the proposal which they attribute to Enron and would like
documentation.  Could someone please forward the appropriate documents
to me.  I also suggested that the Chamber and Enron circle back to
discuss the item in greater detail as soon as possible.

State energy contracts must be paid off by users in system

By Ed Mendel  
 SAN DIEGO UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 

July 12, 2001 


SACRAMENTO -- California businesses are being hit by big electricity rate
increases, some as high as 100 percent, and they would like to be able to
shop around for cheaper power. 


But state regulators are poised to ban customer choice, or ""direct access""
as it has come to be called, because they want to make sure that enough
customers remain with utilities to pay for state power purchases. 


After a month of closed-door talks, the revelation that the state has signed
$43 billion worth of long-term power contracts at above-market prices helped
scuttle an attempt to work out a compromise in the Assembly.

ml> Senate panel, energy firm fighting tough 
  

  <http://www.signonsandiego.com/images/trans_1x1.gif>    

""If the intent of the big customers is to leave the small customers paying
for those contracts, we are going to fight like hell,"" said Lenny Goldberg,
a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network. 


Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology
Association, said large business users were offering to pay off the back
debt of Southern California Edison, estimated at $3.5 billion, in exchange
for direct access. 


""I thought we were making a lot of progress until the information on the
contracts came out,"" Stewart said. ""We really don't have a way of dealing
with those contracts."" 


Now Stewart is suggesting that direct access be slowly phased in over a
period of years and that the long-term power contracts be renegotiated,
perhaps with some being switched from the state to big-business users. 


The manufacturers association and the California Chamber of Commerce helped
organize a business coalition, Californians for Energy Action, that wants a
cheaper alternative to power purchased for utility customers by the state. 


""Many large and small California businesses have seen their electric bills
double,"" says a newspaper ad being run by the coalition this week. ""These
cost increases are a burden that will cause consumer prices to increase,
some businesses to fail and jobs to be lost."" 


A rate increase approved by the state Public Utilities Commission for PG&E
and Edison customers in May fell heaviest on business users. The PUC said
that the average residential increase was about 50 percent, while the
average business increase was about 75 percent. 


Legislation that authorized the state to begin buying power in January for
the utilities, who were crippled by a failed deregulation plan, bars rate
increases for residential customers who use up to 130 percent of the
baseline, the minimal amount deemed necessary for a household. 


Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton, D-San Francisco, and other
legislators have argued that large businesses should bear most of the burden
of the failed deregulation plan because it was business, not residential
consumers, who pushed for deregulation. 


Alan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said that
forcing businesses to bear a ""disproportionate"" rate increase will cost
everyone through higher prices for goods and services and possibly a loss of
jobs. 


""If government didn't allow implementation of deregulation in the right
manner,"" Zaremberg said, ""then we all have to find a solution. We are all in
this together, and that's residential and business alike."" 


The legislation that authorized the state to buy power also directed the PUC
to ban direct access power purchases, if the loss of rate revenue from the
departing customers would harm the ability to pay off a power bond. 


The state plans to issue a bond of up to $13.4 billion in September or
October to repay the taxpayer-supported state general fund for power
purchases. The bond would be paid off by ratepayers over 15 years. 


Last week, the Senate rejected a bill by Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey,
on a 19-12 vote that would have allowed businesses to shop for power if they
paid an ""exit fee"" to protect the bond payments. Business groups said the
fee was too large and would not result in lower power costs. 


""I cannot carry a direct-access bill that makes it harder to sell the bonds
or that shifts costs from large users, who leave for cheaper power, to
smaller users and residential ratepayers,"" Bowen said. 


Burton and Bowen have both criticized Gov. Gray Davis' plan to keep Southern
California Edison from joining Pacific Gas and Electric in bankruptcy. They
say the plan, which includes the state purchase of the Edison transmission
system, is too generous to Edison. 


Both Burton and Bowen have suggested that an Edison bankruptcy may not be a
calamity. But in the Assembly, Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys,
launched a drive for an alternative Edison rescue plan that was based on
gaining business support by offering direct access. 


Hertzberg asked a former Democratic assemblyman, Phil Isenberg of
Sacramento, to try to work out an agreement among the various special
interest groups: business, labor, consumers and generators. 


The basic plan considered by the Isenberg group would have left ""core""
customers -- residences and small businesses -- in a regulated system
receiving power at stable prices from the generators and contracts retained
by the utilities. 


Businesses and other large users, the ""non-core"" customers, would be free to
shop around for low-cost power by 2003 if they agreed to help pay off the
Edison debt. 


The Edison rate increase for large users would be limited to 50 percent. The
PUC would create a ""balancing account"" to track costs, issuing a refund if
too much was collected or raising rates if revenue fell short. 


Business and generator groups told Hertzberg last week that they reached
agreement on a general framework, with the exception of the state purchase
of the Edison transmission system and some other issues. But the consumer
and labor representatives opposed the framework. 


Mike Florio of The Utility Reform Network said in a dissenting statement
that an across-the-board allocation of state power costs would be ""clearly
unfair"" and cause residential users to subsidize direct-access customers. 


Hertzberg said he is considering some of the ideas in the framework
presented by the Isenberg group and may make a proposal in a week or two. 


""We are looking at all the possibilities,"" Hertzberg said. ""We are trying to
do some form of direct access within the current contract structure.""

Subject:	California Meeting





Here's the latest info. about the FERC meeting.  Only Commissioners and their
Staffs will be attending, no additional FERC Staff (no one from the Office of
Markets and Tariff Rates).  The Meeting is mostly an opportunity for customers
to blow off steam.  Presentations will be made by the three IOUs, one 
generator,
one marketer (Enron) and one ESP, UCAN, and various politicians.  When I get 
the
list I'll forward it.  Each presenter will have about five minutes with no
questions from the audience.  Panelists should expect questions and discussion
among panelists or in response to Commissioner's questions.

Attached is the latest FERC notice about the California meeting.  It 
recognizes
that there may be discussions about pending FERC cases.  This does not mean 
FERC
will be grilling our panelist about these cases.  Rather, FERC has to issue 
this
notice so if someone talks about an issue pending in one of those cases, the

Steve:  I'm going to give you a call.  Few things:
Got your message.  As you'll see from the document, I likely spent too much 
time over the weekend on the ""what's in it for consumers"" messages.  Since it 
was one of the the ""to do"" items, I figured that it should get some emphasis, 
but sounds like that may not be the case.
I've proposed a template for how to provide feedback on the Gov's specific 
proposals, using direct investment in power plants by the state as the 
illustrative example.  Let me know if you think it works.  I have ideas on 
each, but thought it better to await feedback from the commercial folks 
before filling out our comments in each area.
I'm finishing up a bit more detailed proposal for how the Gov might use 
""energy gurus"" to help on the portfolio/procurment issues, and am also 
offering additional detail on the need for a ""rate summit.""
Got messages in to Schroeder re: Nordpool--expect to hear back from him today 
at some point and I can drop that info into the document soon as I get it.
Will talk to EES at 10 AM CST to discuss their proposals.  If you'd like to 
join that call, let me know and I'll forward along the call-in number, which 
I think you may already have in your email.
Have received a few comments from ENA that I'll incorporate.

Energy Boss Says State Summer Blackouts 'Appear Inevitable' 
Carolyn Lochhead, Chronicle Washington Bureau
Friday, March 16, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/16/MN20
0965.DTL 
Washington -- The Bush administration warned yesterday that blackouts ""appear 
inevitable"" in California this summer, but it firmly rebuffed a deal from 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein that would force the state to lift its rate freeze on 
consumers in exchange for federal controls on wholesale prices. 
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham insisted that price controls would make 
shortages worse by reducing power sales into the state. The administration's 
top priority is to prevent blackouts, he said. 
""Let me make one point clear,"" Abraham told the Senate Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee. ""Any action we take must either help increase supply or 
reduce demand. . . . Price caps will not increase supply or reduce demand. In 
fact, in our view, they will seriously aggravate the supply crisis."" 
Abraham said electricity shortages in California ""will get worse, and 
blackouts this summer appear inevitable."" He cited projections of anywhere 
from 20 to 200 hours of rolling outages this summer. 
""I'm not saying that people in California don't want lower energy costs,"" he 
said. ""But I know for sure they don't want to be sitting this summer without 
electricity at all. And our goal is to try to avoid that as the primary 
public interest responsibility of this administration."" 
Feinstein became the first leading state Democrat to break with Gov. Gray 
Davis in calling for an end to the rate freeze that has kept electricity 
prices low for California consumers, even as soaring wholesale costs have 
driven the state's investor-owned utilities to bankruptcy and now are 
draining the state's budget surplus. 
But Feinstein insisted that the federal government must simultaneously force 
down wholesale prices until ample new power plants come online. 
Feinstein said higher consumer rates would encourage conservation, saying 
that if people just turned off their computers at night, they would save 7 
percent of the state's electricity supply. 
She also said the state, which now is buying electricity for the utilities, 
has already run through $2.7 billion and could spend $10 billion on 
electricity this year. 
""That is gone,"" Feinstein said. ""It doesn't buy a school. It doesn't repair a 
road. It doesn't build the water system many of us believe the state needs."" 
The offer came as a compromise with Oregon Republican Sen. Gordon Smith, who 
warned that an ""economic and environmental catastrophe"" awaits the Western 
states this summer when electricity demand is expected to soar while a 
drought in the Northwest constricts the supply of hydroelectric power. 
Smith's move to embrace price controls, which he had earlier rejected, 
reflected sharply intensifying political pressure on the Bush administration 
to intervene in the electricity market, as Western officials complained 
bitterly yesterday that rising energy prices are forcing layoffs and now 
threaten the region's economy. 
LESSONS OF SUPPLY, DEMAND
""I'm afraid this summer we're going to be in the middle of a dry lakebed 
explaining to very angry farmers and homeowners and former factory workers 
the lessons of supply and demand,"" said Smith, whose family owns a frozen 
vegetables business. ""I don't want to send the wrong signals to the 
marketplace . . . but I'll tell you, the wrong signal is a recession."" 
Abraham repeatedly sought to counter criticism that the Bush administration 
is not doing enough to aid the West, citing a letter he sent to Davis 
yesterday that said the White House will not oppose the state's plan to take 
over the investor-owned utilities' transmission lines, despite disagreeing 
with the approach. 
""Regrettably, I think our opposition to price caps has been claimed by some 
to suggest that the administration either does not care about California and 
the West or is doing nothing to help,"" Abraham said. ""That is simply untrue."" 
Abraham said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's recent order to 13 
power suppliers to refund $69 million in January overcharges to the utilities 
would send ""a signal that companies that exploit a serious situation aren't 
going to get away with it."" 
He also cited expedited federal approvals and waivers for power plants and 
discussions with Mexico to try to increase electricity exports from Baja to 
California. 
But Abraham firmly rejected price caps, saying they ""have already been tried 
and already failed"" in California when a price ceiling for electricity sales 
into the state was reduced over the past year from $750 a megawatt hour to 
$150. 
RESULTS OF PRICE CAPS
""The lower the price cap was set, the higher average electricity prices 
rose,"" Abraham said, in part because municipal utilities were exempt. New 
federal price caps would affect just half of the Western electricity market, 
he said, and so would shift supplies from regulated to unregulated markets 
rather than control prices. 
He also said price caps would ""almost certainly"" reduce sales from Mexico and 
Canada and induce ""cheating and circumvention."" 
Armed with charts showing huge wholesale price increases over the past year, 
Feinstein expressed her strong disappointment. 
""Oh, Mr. Secretary,"" Feinstein said, ""I was really surprised by the ideologic 
hardness of your statement. I must tell you that."" 
She said California will be 5,000 megawatts short of electricity this summer, 
enough power for 5 million homes. ""It's a lot of shortness,"" she said, 
predicting that prices will reach $5,000 a megawatt hour. ""What does 
California do about that if it isn't going to get any help to provide that 
stability and reliability over that period of time? . . . All we're asking 
for is help to prevent price-gouging."" 
Abraham countered that the administration's position is ""common sense."" 
""I'm telling you, I think this summer, if California has worse blackouts than 
currently projected, that (price caps) would have been a disservice to the 
people of your state,"" Abraham said. ""If the rest of the West finds the 
Canadian energy providers refusing to sell at the same levels because of 
price caps . . . that's in my judgment an irresponsible carrying out of our 
public responsibilities here."" 
In Sacramento, Davis said he was ""particularly grateful"" for the 
administration's promise not to oppose the state transmission takeover. He 
also said the state would ""have just enough power to avoid blackouts"" but 
said ""federal officials are of a different view."" 
Still, the governor continued to urge ''some effort to temper wholesale 
prices.""

Greetings:

Steve Kean and I met today with Jack Stewart, Pres. of the California 
Manufacturer's and Technology Ass. and Alan Zaremberg, CEO of the California 
Chamber of Commerce.

Jack Stewart was happy to hear about our efforts and is generally 
supportive--particularly regarding direct access--but wants more information 
regarding the core/noncore proposal.  We have a meeting set up for Thursday 
morning at 8 AM in the SF office to discuss it further.  Stewart will bring 
Keith McCrea, long-time lawyer for CMA to the meeting on Thursday.

Zaremberg was extremely happy to hear about our efforts and the overall 
package, and was much more receptive to the core/noncore proposal.  Though 
he, too, would like more details.  Turns out the he and Bill Hauck--former 
Wilson administration official and now head of the California Business 
Roundtable---have been walking the halls of the capital urging the same thing 
we've been urging, i.e., D's and R's need to get together (read ""grow up"") 
and do a comprehensive deal.

Steve and I had an impromptu meeting with Hauck, and then I followed up with 
him in the afternoon---he, too, is very supportive.

We stressed how important it is for business leaders to aggresively support 
and pitch:

1) the idea that both sides of the aisle, and the governor, need to resolve 
this now, and 
2) the framework for a comprehensive solution along the lines that we've 
described.   

They agree, and while we have a good bit of additional work to due before 
they are vociferous advocates for the core/noncore proposal, they certainly 
didn't reject the idea.

Will report back on the Thursday follow-up with CMTA.

Best,

		 Subject: Response to ORA/TURN petition

Mike - Here is the situation.  Between ENA and EES, we sell gas to core and 
non-core customers, and also have gas in storage as well as in the park and 
lend service.  I think we can be sympathetic to the ORA argument that the 
diversion tariff penalties did not anticipate OFOs and EFOs in situations 
such as we face here (shortages due to credit problems rather than lack of 
supply).  Assessing extreme penalties, as the OFO/EFOs would do, on users who 
are not perfectly imbalance under this situation certainly seems unfair.  
However, I think we should argue that limiting the payments to 
shippers/customers whose gas is diverted to serve core customers to a market 
index may not fully compensate for the diversion.  The pay back specifically 
does not include interstate pipeline charges, and there may be other costs as 
well to the marketer/customer who had supplies taken away.  

I need an estimate of the cost to make this filing and follow it up for the 
RCR process, and I would also like any feedback anyone has on what our 
position should be in this matter.  The response is due Friday.

Greetings Severin:

No, I'm not writing inquiring about employment as a research analyst (despite Enron's woes, which I'm sure you've been reading about).  

However, my fiancee, Prentice Sellers, who got her MBA from Haas last May, is actively looking for work at an interesting place.  I wanted to let you know that she has applied for a position at the consulting firm that you're affiliated with.  

Forgive the less-than-objective plug, but she's extremely bright and talented and did very well at Haas. Prior to attending Haas, she worked at LECG, where she was highly praised for her work and consistently got rave reviews.

She'd be a valuable asset to the firm and is worth giving a serious look.

Thanks for reading this paid advertisment.

On another note, I thought the Hoover conference was extremely good.  You and Sweeney did a great job.  What was your impression?  I've noticed that it got some decent press.

wanted to try to make sure Bob was available and 4) she would call Bob back

This looks very good.  One suggestion:  May be a little ambitious to do #2, and really ambitious to do #2 for the entire West.  May want to priortize in some small way, like, what are the 5 things that most affect the book (maybe confined to California?).  Just a suggestion.  I'm comfortable doing the whole nine yards.  Just concerned that we may fail to cover some really big risks that are lurking on the horizon in the near term if we choose not to focus down just a bit.

That said, seems real important to complete the comprehensive view as you've set out in the agenda as soon as we can (e.g., next four weeks, or so).

DELETE IF NOT A BART SHUTTLE RIDER.

A BART shuttle rider recently suggested that the shuttle leave 5 minutes
earlier (9:35 pm rather than 9:40 pm) to accommodate the BART schedule.
Apparently, the extra five minutes gets students to the station just
shortly after BART leaves, causing students to wait until the next train
20 minutes later.

If you a BART shuttle rider, please provide me some feedback.

Thanks,

Business&Finance: ESB ownership of network is questioned - Competition 
Authority says separation of national grid from core company does not go far 
enough. Arthur Beesley reports 
  
11/13/2000 
Irish Times 
18 
Copyright (C) 2000 Irish Times; Source: World Reporter (TM) 

The Competition Authority has questioned the ESB's ownership of the 
electricity network in the newly deregulated power market.

In a paper submitted to the Department of Public Enterprise, the body said 
the separation of the ESB's National Grid operation from the core company did 
not go far enough to ensure fair competition. 

It said arguments in favour of the ESB retaining the transmission and 
distribution system ignored the 'overwhelming conclusion' that a generation 
company which owns such assets 'will naturally favour itself' at the expense 
of customers and reliability.

The paper has not been published yet. It is believed to state, however, that 
the ESB's retention of its 'non-competitive' transmission and distribution 
assets and its 'competitive' electricity generation business was unwise from 
a competition perspective.

The National Grid, which controls when individual power stations feed 
electricity into the network, was separated from the ESB when 27 per cent of 
the market was opened last February.

In theory, this meant the ESB could not favour its own generation stations 
over more efficient competitors when deciding which plant to switch on and 
off as demand for power fluctuates.

But the authority's response to the Statutory Instrument behind the 
separation - which renamed the National Grid as Eirgrid - said more should be 
done to ensure the market operates fairly.

The paper said: 'Some argue that as long as there is an independent operator 
of the underlying transmission system, ownership of the transmission system 
can remain in the hands of an upstream generation operator.

'In accordance with this line of argument, the shift of operational control 
of electricity transmission to Eirgrid would mean that discrimination in 
dispatch [of power] and other operations would not be possible. However, the 
Competition Authority considers that this argument ignores the overwhelming 
conclusion that the generation company that owns the transmission lines will 
naturally favour itself.'

The Statutory Instrument followed complex talks, which led to an agreement 
between the ESB, its trade unions and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Ms 
O'Rourke.

When Eirgrid was formed, the ESB retained ownership and responsibility to 
develop and maintain the high-voltage national transmission system and the 
low-voltage local distribution network.

The authority says these, too, should be separated from the ESB to ensure the 
competitive market functions fairly, according to a person familiar with its 
paper.

This would ensure equal access to the power network and an objective, 
transparent, non-discriminatory treatment of all electricity generators in 
the market, it said.

The paper argues the ESB has an incentive to allocate as many costs as 
possible to the operation of the transmission and distribution system.

Response from Peevey/Freeman:
Be as creative as possible.  All offers will be considered (despite the=20

Here's the latest that we have on the legislation (""82XX"") released on Friday.
The Assembly Energy Committee will hold an ""informational"" hearing on 82XX at 
1:30 PM PDT today.
""Informational"" means that there won't be a vote today.
Attended a meeting this morning with the business groups with Assemblyman 
Dutra (self-proclaimed pro-biz Democrat, who's an ""author""  of 82XX), 
Hertzberg's chief staffer, and Hertzberg's outside legal consultant.
The DWR contracts continue to be the roadblock to a rational solution.
Dutra is unhappy with the process thus far----claimed he wasn't familiar with 
the ""more recent version"" of the bill, and was unhappy that there would be a 
hearing today---informational or otherwise--before he and the bill's other 
authors had agreed to final language from their perspective.
Dutra said that he was working to remove the Direct Access suspension and 
asked the biz groups to hold their fire until the amendments come out 
tomorrow.
PUC President Lynch continues to oppose striking a deal in which the 
Commission gives up all review of DWR's ""revenue requirement"" and simply 
flows all DWR costs through rates (but Davis and his administration are 
putting her under enormous pressure to buckle under and agree).
As a result, details of any ""rate agreement"" between DWR and the CPUC, and 
any public announcement by DWR of its ""revenue requirement"" is could be 
postponed until next week, unless there's a breakthrough with Loretta.
The Governor's consultants now claim (and will reportedly testify at the 
hearing today) that there is enough room in the 3 cent rate increase to cover 
both Edison's and DWR's revenue requirements.  (They cite lower gas prices 
and FERC's price cap as the driving force for the newly-found headroom, 
though many remain very skeptical.)
However, if the deal is applied to PG&E, it is unlikely that the 3 cent rate 
would be sufficient, according to the same consultants.
The plan (at this point) is to have the bill--with amendments--discussed in 
the same committee tomorrow, and voted out of the committee.  The bill would 
then be taken to the full Assembly for an up or down vote on Wednesday.
It is unclear whether, at this point, there is agreement among Assembly 
Democrats to vote the bill out of the full Assembly on Wednesday.
In addition, Senate Democrats continues to work on their own version  of an 
Edison ""MOU,"" and the working relationship between the Assembly side and the 
Senate side appears strained.
The Republicans in the Assembly are staunchly opposed to 82XX and are 
generally being ignored by the Democrats, since the Democrats need no 
Republicans to get a majority vote to pass bills.
Meanwhile, Edison continues to twist.

Will report back after the 1:30 hearing today.

		 Subject: Re: Cost of Protectionism

Jeff,
 In order for California to ""shut its doors"" it must open its 
interconnections with the rest of the west and become a Texas-like electrical 
island.  This they cannot do.  California has a substantial investment in 
units located in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.  The lights would go 
out in California if they opened the ties.  In the 1970's there was a hue and 
cry over loop flow, with California claiming that it was being injured by 
others, particularly by the interior systems trading practices, however they 
never considered opening the ties, because the benefits of interconnection 
were so large that the ""cost"" of loop flow was far exceeded by the value of 
regional trade, i.e., they are economically interdependent.

 If such a foolish thing were done and California full ""closed its doors"" by 
opening its ties, cost would go up in the Northwest, in California and all 
the rest of the Western System.  There are ""gains for trade"" which accrue to 
all parties from interconnection.  The trade is more complicated than just 
summer/winter peaks (seasonal load diversity) there is also seasonal resource 
diversity (Spring run off effects) and finally there opportunity to 
capitalize on storage vs base load thermal operations.  I will address the 
last point first to illustrate the complexity of the trading patterns.

 The interior west (Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico) has large 
amount of base load coal plants.  As load drops off in those areas, the 
energy flows to the coast to back off peaking plants and to back off hydro.  
The reduction of hydro production allows night time reservoir refill which 
can be used to meet peak load in the Northwest and California.  This can be 
seen in the attached file, which contains a set of plots for hourly flow on 
the Pacific DC Intertie Jun97, Dec 97, Jun 98, Dec 98, Jun 99, Dec 99, 
Jun00.  In these plots the clear day/night exchange of energy can be seen, 
especially in the Jun00 plot when sales are being made to California in the 
day and to the Northwest at night.  This day to night storage exchange 
benefits lowers costs for everyone.

 On top of this daily/weekly cycle, there is the seasonal shift in load 
diversity you noted.  For the Northwest, its peak load occurs when energy 
production is the lowest -- during the winter.  As a stand alone system, the 
Pacific Northwest (i.e., the Columbia Drainage area) is energy constrained.  
The hydro in that area does not produce enough energy to meet annual needs.  
There is plenty of generating capacity to meet any peak, but not enough to 
total water flow.  Energy imports from Wyoming and Montana (e.g. Colstrip and 
Bridger) are required to allow the Pacific Northwest to meet its annual 
energy requirement.  With these energy inputs from the coal fields, the 
seasonal water budget can be arranged to get the most value out of the hydro 
system, although fish, navigation, irrigation, etc. impose an increasing 
number of constraints.  Energy imports from in the winter from the South help 
to meet this energy balance during the winter so water can be reserved until 
the snow pack is better know in early Spring.  Some of the sales to the 
Northwest from California during the winter are a result of displacement from 
Desert Southwest energy moving through California and then up the Interties 
to the Northwest.  

 Finally, the Spring run off/fish flush when production on the river is at a 
maximum and load in the Northwest is down.  The sale of these surpluses paid 
for the Pacific Intertie lines and remain important to the entire system.  
Much system maintenance of base load units has been historically been planned 
to take advantage of this factor.  Again both California and the Northwest 
benefit from this trade.  

 In all cases, the parties would be worse off if the ties were open and 
everyone was on their own.  The Northwest may be capacity long, but it is 
typically energy short, even in flush hydro years.  The winter energy imports 
from the South hold Northwest costs down just as spring run off sales to the 
South lower energy costs in California.  California cannot craft a solo 
solution that ignores the rest of the West.  It is probably hard to decide 
who would be worst off if California ""closed its doors"".  It is only clear 
that total cost would rise in both California and the rest of the West from 
which it divorced itself.

 I hope this rambling response comes at the question you raise.

Steve

		 Subject: Re: Cost of Protectionism

To Jim's last point.  I understand that the good 'ol utility system was often 
operated with little regard for basic economic principles, but there's 
something in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess, and it seems 
to always be tied to this notion that ""California is a net importer, even in 
the winter.""  I'm going to start with the economics and then let folks 
describe why it seemingly doesn't apply in Western electricity markets.

Just about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion:  
If California closes it's doors the other Western states will pay higher 
prices for power and/or face increased threats to reliability.  I'm 
struggling to try to determine why these basic principles aren't applicable 
to Western power markets.  I understand that the PNW is a very complex place 
and that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has 
developed over the years.

To keep it simple (though not necessarily accurate), I've confined the 
analysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist.

The basic situation: The PNW peaks in the winter; California peaks in the 
summer.

Let's take two scenarios:

1)  The West, less California, is so awash in electricity that even in its 
peak--the Winter--it still has power to send to California, i.e., it has so 
overbuilt it's system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California.

Irrespective, there have (to my limited knowledge) always been sales from CA 
to the PNW during the winter, when the PNW is peaking.
The only conclusion that one can make, assuming that the PNW is awash in 
electricity, is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makes 
economic sense to do so. That is, during the winter peaking months, it must 
be cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather than 
produce itself.  Otherwise, it's difficult to understand why it would buy 
from California during this month, particularly if they're long.  As such, at 
a minimum, the PNW's electric bill will necessarily increase if California 
closes its doors.

2) Neither the PNW , nor California, has indigenous capacity to meet peaking 
load.  Therefore, the PNW must buy California's power during its peaking 
summer period, and California must buy power during it's summer peaking 
period.  In this case, not only will the PNW's bill go up if California 
closes its doors, the lights are likely to go because they'll be short power.

I realize that this is a simplistic model, and that there could be other 
legitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW 
(e.g., transmission costs).  And again, I also realize that economics may not 
have traditionally been a driver in the industry.  But I thought it might be 
useful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the 
question that Jim asks.

With that, I'll pose the question (understanding the simplicity of the model 
set forth above):  Given that California sends power north--even if the PNW 
is long---how can California closing it doors not increase the PNW's cost of 
power?

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: Re: Cost of Protectionism

It seems to me that this information leads one to conclude that the value of 
an open transmission network is that California does not have to build 5,000 
MW of power plant (4,500 MW max input + 10%) in state.  In other words, if 
California were to disconnect from the grid, someone would have to build 
additional power plants in-state.

The cost to California consumers is therefore the annual carrying cost of 10 
500 MW plants (made even more expensive after California expropriates the 
current fleet of merchant generation).

From the perspective of the remainder of the West, the question still remains 
- if California does go it alone, what is the economic impact?  Other than 
legal arguments about Interstate Commerce, why should the Federal Government 
want to continue to pursue open acess?  This is the hard question that we 
need to answer.

		 Subject: Cost of Protectionism

Jim, Jeff:

Jim asked me in a voice mail what would be the cost to California of moving 
from the current (evolving) system of open access to a ""protectionist"" 
environment where access to the grid would be determined by a political body 
responding to populist pressures.

Here are some things to consider.  We can talk more and I welcome Sue Mara or 
Steve Walton's input:

California is a net importer so any restraint of trade would risk the state 
being able to meet its own demand.  See attached slides that show PNW-CA 
trade.  Even in the winter, power on a net basis flows south.

Limiting open access would primarily act to hold in-state generators hostage.
 this will kill incentives for new investment

If the ISO's proposal for market power mitigation are any guide of where a 
protectionist ISO would go:
 in-state generators would be required to sell forward or lose their market 
based rate certificates
 load serving entities would be required to contract forward for load and a 
reserve margin.  
  This is costly: it will lead to centralized planning solutions to 
reliability rather than more efficient market     outcomes
 Artifical notions of ""just and reasonable"" rates (on top of unreasonable 
reserve requirements) would lead to severe   reliability problems.  (In other 
words, if Steve Peace has his way, the imports into the state will drop 
off     signficanly)

There is no reason the state would be more effective at expanding the grid 
(e.g., Path 15) than the current system.  (Although, admittedly the current 
system has flaws.  The CAISO was set up with little thought to transmission 
expansion planning.  Other RTOs are not repeating this mistake.).

Comrades:

Attached you will find the call assignments for the
new admits.  We all have five or six people to call in
the next 7-10 days.   I made a couple of matches where
it seemed there was some kind of similarity in
background or career, but for the most part, the
assignments were essentially random.  The list
includes names, phones at home and work, company and
title.

Remember these are newly admitted students who have
not yet accepted our offer of admission.  The deadline
to accept this offer is April 27th.

A general outline of the phone call, should you choose
to use it, would be:

1) Congratulations on being admitted to the Haas
School

2) indentify yourself as ""involved with the student
government at the Haas School, and the evening office
asked me to give you a call to see if you had any
questions about the program.  Then answer the
questions, if you can, or refer them to me or Ken for
further follow-up

3)describe your own experience at school and how it
has worked with your career--timing, advancement,
scheduling, tuition payments, etc.

4)invite them to attend a class so we can show them
around.  EMBA office will coordinate.

5)remind them of the ""New Students Admit Reception"" on
April 19th from 7-9 in the Wells Fargo Room (drinks
and hors d'oeuvres served). (Refer to Diane's recent
email for other particulars.

Some pieces of information you might want to have
handy

-required new student orientation is August 11-12;
classes start on the 13th

-fees will be $1580 per unit; 42 units required,
including the two units for MPAR

-orientation packages will be sent out mid-June

-administration will call each new student in July
with class schedules

-second round of admits come out in early June

Thanks very much for helping.  Let me know if there is
anything else you may need or could suggest to help in
this effort.

Sacramento -- The state Senate approved a plan yesterday to keep Southern 
California Edison from falling into bankruptcy, but the bill crafted as an 
alternative to the pact between the utility and Gov. Gray Davis faces an 
uncertain future. 
The bill by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of 
Palo Alto would give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's 
transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $2.5 
billion of the utility's debt. Edison amassed an estimated $3.5 billion in 
debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained 
frozen. 
The Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last 
night, but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of 
mistakes that led to California's botched 1996 deregulation legislation 
haunted lawmakers. 
Davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk 
before Aug. 15, a date set in the original agreement between Davis and 
Edison. 
Lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night, 
but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town. 
""It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior 
to the end of the legislative recess,"" Davis said of the Aug. 15 date. 
Davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to 
iron out differences between the two bills, but it is unclear whether that 
could be accomplished in the next few days. 
""I have problems with both bills,"" Davis said. ""I am heartened by the fact 
that there's a bill moving in each house."" 
Both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to 
a floor vote, and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the 
process. 
In the Senate, 22 Democrats voted for the Edison plan, while four Democrats 
and all 13 Republicans voted no. 
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she would vote for the bill in its 
current form, but not if any substantial changes are made. 
""The Legislature is ill-equipped to try to craft a deal,"" she said. ""This 
particular measure -- and only this one -- has the intent and clarity to 
protect ratepayers. I'm leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being 
cannibalized."" 
The Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue $2.5 billion in bonds to pay off 
alternative energy producers and their banks. The bonds would be paid off 
through increased rates charged Edison's largest customers and would not 
cover the $1 billion Edison owes out-of-state generators. 
Edison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy, 
which would put it back in the position of buying power. 
The state has been spending upward of $50 million a day on power since 
January, and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the 
utility can once again begin buying power. There is also hope that any deal 
would be used as a way to get Pacific Gas & Electric Co. out of bankruptcy. 
In the Assembly, two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change 
their bill. The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman 
Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, was undergoing changes to 
garner more support. 
Some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines 
and taking municipal utilities out of the deal. 
Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D-San Jose, one of the undecided members on the 
Edison agreement, said the original bill was too complex. 
""It's a cleaner bill,"" Alquist said. ""I think it comes down to whether this 
does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG&E. I would say 
I'm tentatively satisfied."" 
Alquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature 
of the Edison negotiations. Only a few members of the Assembly -- all former 
state senators now in the lower house -- voted to approve the 1996 
legislation, AB1890, that brought deregulation to California. 
Assemblyman Joseph Simitian, D-Palo Alto, said he gave a courtesy vote to the 
Hertzberg-Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee, in order to get the 
measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate. 
""As we've learned from the experience of AB1890, the devil is in the details. 
I have a lot of questions,"" Simitian said. ""The difficulty is that very 
little gets done here until there is a deadline, and then once there is a 
deadline, too much gets done."" 
Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was 
getting rushed, but he said lawmakers are well-informed about the energy 
crisis and its details. He said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings 
and countless hearings on the crisis. 
A wild card in the Assembly's plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D- 
Los Angeles, that garnered Republican support. The so-called ""straight 
bailout"" would give Edison its $3.5 billion through a $2-a-month fee levied 
on utility ratepayers. It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

The Assembly passed the budget late last night.
The Assembly recessed without passing out any energy bill.
There is some talk of a working group being convened beginning next week 
comprised of Legislative staff and industry to continue to try to work out a 
deal.
For now, however, the free world is safe from the CA Assembly and the 
Senate--they've left and all Legislative activity is on hold until the 20th 
of August, unless leadership, or the Governor tries to bring them back early.
The activity now moves to the PUC.

tech melt down.  I'm good.  Trying to figure out how to plant 10 acres of 
grapes on my land in Mendocino (rather have 10 acres of grapes than a place 
in S.F., I've decided---what do you think?).  I was thinking of taking a pass 
on ""sunner"" school and just going all 6 semesters.  Am I stupid?  Summer 
vacation just sounds so good these days.  Leaving Monday for Mexico.  Back 
Sunday.  When you leaving?  Definitely miss seeing you.   Looking forward to 
catching up---hopefully soon.  You take care.

After Burton's ""proclamation"" yesterday afternoon that Senate bill 78XX was

never made it to the full Senate for a vote.
The bill will be ""reconsidered"" (i.e., voted on again) today in the same 
committee.  

In the Assembly:
Hertzberg's bill (82XX) got voted down initially, until Rod Wright switched 
his vote and let it get out.
82 XX then went to the appropriations committee, where it was voted out, and 
now it's scheduled for a floor vote this morning.
83XX, the bipartisan bill led by Wright (D) and Richman (R), was also voted 
out of committee and will go to appropriations today.

These folks will need to be added to the distribution list.  Lysa/Joseph:  
it's going to be a bit wacky, because, as the note indicates, I'm not sure 
what time the call will be.  Anywhere from about 11 AM to 2 PM PST.  We'll 
need to keep the number of ports as unlimited as possible, because I have a 
feeling that the note indicating that there be a meeting will get around, 
perhaps globally.  As soon as I know what time I'll want to have the call, I 
will notify Joseph, who will need to set up the call and distribute the info 
to the original list I sent around plus the names below.  If you two have 
suggestions on how you'd like to handle, like Ross Perot, I'm all ears.

The Commission just voted out one half of the ""Bilas Alternate.""

The decision that got voted out included Bilas' DWR-based language stating 
that the PUC 1) would not second-guess DWR purchases and 2) would pass 
through DWR costs to customers.
However, in a move led by Commissioner Carl Wood, the decision removed the 
Bilas language on Direct Access.  The decision therefore did NOT include the 
Bilas language staying any Commission action on implementing the Direct 
Access prohibition.  Carl Wood called including Direct Access ""the height of 
arrogance.""  
The decision was voted out 3-2, with the 2 remaining Republicans dissenting.
That said, the Commission has no proposal before it implementing the 
prohibition, and there was no talk at the meeting of implementing the 
prohibition any time soon.

there's no requirement yet to refile anything.  (Welcome to California.)  In

Met early this morning with Jack Steward (pres. of CMA) and Keith McCrea 
(lawyer for CMA) to follow up on the meeting that Steve and I had with them 
regarding the proposal Ken Lay was pushing last week:

They like taking Tx out of the MOU, they like getting DWR out of the power 
purchase business, and they think that Edison's MOU needs a little haircut.
McCrea pushed back initially on core/noncore (""why should it be mandatory to 
go the market?""), but after much discussion they agreed that our idea for 
core/noncore has a lot of merit.
Our idea is that 1) the core/noncore would take effect in 18-24 months, when 
the markets settle and prices come down, 2)  everyone (core and noncore) 
should pay for DWR's ""past"" purchases, since everyone consumed it, 3) core 
customers should take IOU generation, QFs and DWR contracts (which eliminates 
the core's ""net short"" position, and 4) noncore would go to market and would 
not have to pay for any of DWR's ""going forward costs"" (since core gets them, 
in exchange for getting all the low-cost IOU generation)
I told them we are still crunching the numbers to see what the rate effects 
would be and would share it with them when we're done.
While they are supportive of this approach and agreed that it would be useful 
to continue to flesh it out, they are not convinced that it will get the 
necessary support to get passed.  They are also withholding final judgment 
until they see all the numbers, i.e., we've still got some work to do.
They are very cynical about anything getting solved in California, and are 
extremely upset about the PUC's proposed rate decisions released by the judge 
and Loretta Lynch.  They place very little trust in the Governor or the 
Legislature.
Interestingly, the rate increase decisions, coupled with calls in Sacramento 
for an immediate move to core/noncore, makes our proposal very attractive to 
CMA.
Nonetheless, they said that they will continue to engage and are willing to 
commit to continue meet to try to get California's mess resolved.",enron_mail/maildir/kean-s/calendar/untitled/8413,5,5,37,6,0,1,14,14,0,0,364,12,31,68,29,4.392857142857143,31,443,2042,161,198,8

Hi Barry:

Congratulations on side-stepping what many (including us) thought would be a summer filled with supply disruptions. We're as glad as anybody that it hasn't happened. 

I have a quick question:  Your consultant for gas procurement, a fellow named Mark Baldwin, until recently did some consulting work for one of our business units, Transwestern gas pipeline.  Mark has informed us that we won't be able to talk to him in his new role due to conflict of interest considerations that arise from our previous relationship with Mark.

With that in mind, I was wondering if there is someone else working on gas procurement other than Mark (who doesn't face the same conflict issues) that we could meet with to discuss providing low-cost gas services to California?  We're very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a conflict-free environment.  But it would be a shame for the state to forego a good gas deal for the state's consumers.  If there's someone we can talk to and avoid (even the appearance of) conflict-of-interest, we'd be very anxious to do so.

Thanks for your time and hope all is well.

Paul:  Here's additional info for the ""curtailment"" data that we're pulling 
together.

Utility Pricing for Core Gas Customers

Prior to the month in question, the utility forecasts gas prices based on 
NYMEX monthly prices.  So for example, based on November's forecast, the 
utility sets prices to be charged to core consumers in December.

When December's over, the utility compares forecast prices with actual 
prices.  If the forecast was too low, and there's an undercollection, the 
utility will increase January's price forecast by ""just enough"" to make up 
for the December undercollection.  If prices were too high and there's an 
overcollection, the utility will reduce January price forecast by just enough 
to refund the overcollection.

If the overcollection/undercollection is very large, the utilities have 
generally spread out the ""true-up"" over several months to avoid ""rate shock"" 
one way or the other.  However, under the current circumstances, the 
utilities may be less willing to spread it out, and may wish to recover the 
entire undercollection in the following month.  In short, there's at least a 
one-month lag in customer prices to account for differences in forecasts 
versus actual.",enron_mail/maildir/kean-s/notes_inbox/90,9,7,40,9,0,0,3,3,0,0,197,9,23,26,21,4.898477157360406,21,251,1216,85,109,0

Jeff - 

Just to circle back with you with regard to the question whether EES can 
continue to enroll customers (raised in yesterday's SDGE meeting).  While 
still somewhat vague, it is the opinion of Legal that EES may continue to 
enroll new customers until there is commission action making effective that 
section of ABX1 suspending direct access.  One issue requiring further legal 
review is whether the commission can retroactively suspend direct access to 
the effective date of ABX1.  This was communicated to the EES folks in a 
subsequent meeting yesterday.

Power providers cry foul over fees 
State is accused of improper billing 
Electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California's energy market are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gray Davis' administration. 
The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high-priced electricity contracts. 
Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney- Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such industry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant. 
The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour. 
""The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Water Resources is giving them,"" Smutney-Jones said. 
An industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged. 
The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency. 
State officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared California could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought. 
Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to ""bury"" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators. 
""The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control the governing board of the ISO,"" Ackerman said. 
The governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms' accusations ""absolutely false"" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs. 
""The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in Washington than they will in Sacramento,"" Maviglio said. ""It shouldn't be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement."" 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisis. 
""I don't feel sorry for them one bit,"" Hidalgo said. ""They had one heck of a year."" 
Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations. 
Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs. 
The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operating costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said. 
Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand-by power units on too-short notice. When they can't comply, they say, the ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost. 
The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid. In January, Davis disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was chaired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with industry. Davis appointed his own five-member board. 
In February, then-FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become ""a political arm of the governor."" The commission is trying to get California to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization. 
Davis has warned Washington to ""keep its hands off"" the ISO. ",enron_mail/maildir/kean-s/california/1967,8,11,71,8,0,3,14,14,0,0,680,31,23,132,96,4.989705882352941,60,795,4188,253,320,5

PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates
The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:
?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.
?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison's annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.
?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.
?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. 
?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.
?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. 
?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.
?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.
""This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,"" said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  ""The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers.""
This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal.

Folks:

My apologies in advance if I vent somewhat.  

Briefly, some of you know that I attended Berkeley's Policy School.  I have 
been very closely involved with the conference Severin describes in his note 
to Littlechild.  I have been working to try to establish a joint venture 
between the policy and business schools at Berkeley to hold an ""energy 
summit,"" where national and international energy leaders would converge on 
California (under the auspices of UC Berkeley) to talk energy policy.  Jim 
Steffes has helped a lot in brainstorming the idea.  In short,, our goal was 
to have a group of prominent folks squarely refute the extremely retrograde 
notions of ""turn the clock back"" that the Governor of California's two most 
recent appointees have been articulating at every opportunity over the past 
several months, and re-seize the agenda in California. The ""energy heads of 
state"" at the summit would come up with solutions for going forward.

The concept (and invitees) that Severin describes is loosely based on 
proposals I have made to the ""steering committee.""  However, for reasons I 
won't bore you with in this note, the effort has frankly turned into a 
fiasco.  I notified the group this week that Enron would not be 
participating, that they should go forward with the conference without us, 
and that I would help somewhat (contacts, etc.) when (and if) they ever came 
to agreement on the agenda and particpants.  From my perspective, the effort 
turned out to be a rather big disappointment.  I urge us not to get involved 
or contribute $$s.  At this juncture I would recommend against having Ken Lay 
participate.  Depending on how the thing shapes up, we may  or may not want 
to have someone at a substantially lower level participate, but I'm 
pessimistic at this point.  If anyone would like to discuss my reasons in 
more detail, I'd be happy to discuss.

I still think the idea of an energy summit is very promising.  But the forum 
that these folks are creating ain't the right one.

Best,
Jeff

DJ PG&E Says Won't Try To Escape Rate
                  Freeze For Now >PCG 

                  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 


                  SAN FRANCISCO (Dow Jones)--PG&E Corp. (PCG) won't try to 
lift California's
                  state-mandated rate freeze before the end of the transition 
to a deregulated market,
                  saying it wants to protect its customers from volatile 
power prices, senior company
                  officials said Wednesday. 

                       ""We aren't moving at this time to end the rate freeze. 
But that view might change in
                  the future,"" said a senior company official, who requested 
anonymity. 

                       PG&E invited reporters to its headquarters Wednesday 
to discuss plans for repairing
                  a ""not workably competitive power market"" and several steps 
the utility plans to file
                  with federal regulators to do that. 

                       One proposal that is expected to be filed with the 
Federal Energy Regulatory
                  Commission is a return to cost-based rates, where the price 
for power would be
                  predetermined based on generation costs. The company wants 
to temporarily put an
                  end to market-based rates. 

                       The utility will also request that California's 
independent system operator reduce the
                  wholesale power price cap to $100 a megawatt-hour from 
$250/MWh. 

                       Company officials said those steps would allow them to 
recover billions of dollars in
                  unpaid power costs and would stabilize wholesale power 
prices and protect retail
                  customers. 

                       PG&E said generators would still be able to make a 
profit on power sold in California
                  with the reduced cap, and the company doesn't believe the 
state's power supply would
                  be in jeopardy from such an action.

It's hard to disagree with the fact that 1) the utilities are the ones that 
cut the deal they're living with and 2) they took all of the ""stranded cost"" 
money that consumers paid them and invested it in other states and 
countries.  

But you can only buy for 10 cents and sell for 5 cents for so long before 
creditors turn off the spigot.  Difficult to see how the spigot stays on with 
the draft decision issued today.  (See story attached, below.)  

With bankruptcy, the only one making any decisions is the judge, and while 
some see benefits to that, seems to us that from a political, financial and 
commercial perspective, bankruptcy creates many more problems than it solves.

That said, we're extremely sensitive to the politics of rate increases.  But 
if the increases are subject to refund, then decision makers can buy 
themselves some time by erring just slightly to the high side of a rate 
increase, which could fend off the ratings agencies and provide additional 
opportunity over the next 90 days or so to scrutinize the utilities claims 
and come up with comprehensive solutions to the bigger problems.

Well, you got my two cents.  Sorry about that.  

Best,
Jeff

Late afternoon 1/3/01 news:


USA: Calif utility ratings may fall too far on 7-15 pct hike.
By Jonathan Stempel

01/03/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Bankruptcy may loom and the credit ratings of the 
two largest California electric utilities will likely fall too far if that 
state's Public Utilities Commission awards them an interim rate hike of 7 to 
15 percent, analysts said Wednesday.

In a draft decision on Wednesday, the CPUC proposed an immediate hike of 9 
percent for residential customers of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern 
California Edison, and hikes of seven to 15 percent for various business 
customers.

The CPUC commission is expected to issue a final decision on Thursday.

""It forces the utilities and their creditors to be limbo dancers, and skilled 
limbo dancers at that,"" said Shawn Burke, head of U.S. investment-grade 
research at Barclays Capital.

PG&E and SCE had requested respective rate increases of 26 percent and 30 
percent, a hike that would help them avoid imminent bankruptcy.

The utilities have also asked the regulators to remove a freeze on retail 
rates imposed under California's 1996 law that deregulated the state's 
electricity market.

On a day when most stocks roared ahead after the Federal Reserve announced 
surprise interest rate cuts, investors beat down the stocks of Pacific G&E's 
parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. , and SoCal Edison's parent, Edison 
International .

PG&E shares closed Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $17, down 
$2-9/16, or 13.1 percent, while Edison International shares closed at 
$12-1/4, down $2-3/4, or 18.3 percent, on the Big Board.

Bond quotations were not immediately available for the utilities' bonds, 
which in recent weeks have traded like junk.

Pacific G&E and SoCal Edison were banking on a big rate hike to allow them to 
pass on some of their soaring wholesale power costs to consumers.

The utilities, which operate under a rate freeze, have accumulated more than 
$8 billion in unrecovered costs since wholesale power prices started 
skyrocketing last summer amid a worsening electricity shortage in the state. 
They claim they are running out of money due to the price freeze, and have 
billions of dollars of bills coming due in the next six weeks.

Central to their concerns is whether credit rating agencies Moody's Investors 
Service and Standard & Poor's will cut their medium investment grades to junk 
status.

""No one knows for sure, but if we consider the average rate hike is only 
about 10 percent, it will be difficult for the companies to maintain 
investment-grade ratings,"" said Dorothea Matthews, a fixed-income electric 
utilities analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.

The utilities have already been unable to tap short-term capital markets 
because of their precarious financial state.

Downgrades to junk, which the agencies have already threatened, would cement 
the door shut to these markets, and cause the utilities to default on some of 
their loans.

Late Wednesday, PG&E Chief Executive Gordon Smith said the commission's 
proposed hikes could jeopardize his utility's future loans.

Even a downgrade to the lowest investment grades - ""Baa3"" for long-term debt 
and ""Prime-3"" for short-term debt from Moody's, and ""BBB-minus"" and ""A3"" from 
S&P - would make the going very difficult for the utilities. The reason: 
short-term debt markets are often closed to companies with those ratings.

""Unless this process allows the rating agencies to keep 'A2/P2' ratings on 
the short-term debt of both companies, then this process has largely been a 
waste of everyone's time,"" said Burke.

Still, he said, ""there is a reasonable chance, despite today's weak 
recommendation, that the situation can be salvaged with mid-'triple-B' 
ratings, which would allow a lifeline to conventional sources of liquidity.""

Moody's and S&P were not available for comment.

Summary of the activities since Friday:

Overall, it's 50-50 or better that the Legislature will finish up the budget and recess until August 20th, without having passed some form of an ""Edison MOU."" Will have a better view of the chances of getting an MOU agreed to and passed through both houses by COB Monday.  

In the Senate:
The ""Edison MOU"":
As previously reported, on Friday, SB 78---the Senate's version of the Edison MOU--passed out of the full Senate and was sent to the full Senate.
The bill sticks 100% of suppliers' debts with Edison's shareholders but pays QFs and other creditors.
The authors believe that suppliers can't force Edison into bankruptcy because the claims are with the PX, not Edison, which in their view means that the suppliers can't reach Edison.  Our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic is strong from a legal perspective. 
The bill creates an option to buy the transmission system, but rejects the Goernor's MOU, which buys it outright.
Though there's some uncertainty, the bill appears to end Direct Access.
Information we have indicates that the Assembly does not support and will not pass SB 78 in its current form.
Enron (and the marjority of market participants) opposes 78.

The ""Dunn Investigation"":
Dunn released his report regarding contempt charges against Enron on Saturday.
The report recommends that the Senate fine us, beginning with $1,000 the first day, and doubling everyday thereafter until Enron ""complies.""
Dunn announced on Saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the full Senate for a vote on Saturday.
In response, our lobbyist in Sacramento spoke to a leader of the Republican party in the Senate (Ross Johnson), and persuaded Johson to negotiate the date of the vote with Burton and Dunn.
She was successful---Johnson went to Burton and got him and Dunn to agree not to vote on the report until the Senate returned from its recess on August 20th.
If the Senate returns early, it could vote prior to the 20th, but the likelihood of that happening appears low at this time.

The budget:
The Senate passed the budget at about 1 AM Sunday morning.
The Senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return until August 20th.
That leaves the Assembly alone in Sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the Edison MOU.

The Assembly
In short, leadership within the Assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party--the Democrats.  
The Speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue.
Unable to do a deal, the Assembly recessed Saturday night and has not reconvened. 
It has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget.
The Assembly also has not passed its version of an Edison MOU, which it says it intends to do.
Best information we have right now is that the Assembly does not plan to go back into session until Tuesday morning.
Late Saturday night, the Assembly Speaker released yet another version of his Edison MOU (AB 82XX), but it does not appear at this time that he has enough votes among Assembly Democrats to pass it.
Enron--together with business customers--opposes the version of 82XX released on Saturday night because it does not adequately ensure Direct Access.

FYI.  Hertzberg and Keeley were in the negotiations this morning.  We gave 
him an earful about this coming down the pike, and the fact that the 
contracts (which are too expensive and which no one wants) are driving 
everything and unless something gives, we can pack it up, go home and turn 
the keys over the Freeman and his bozos at DWR.  

The Sacramento types are mobilized on the issue and Hertzberg said that he's 
going to meet with the Governor and call Loretta.  We meet again tomorrow at 
10 to discuss the need to get rid of the contracts and to keep DA alive.

Please don't use this yet.  Refinements are underway by Alan Comnes, but

Talked to Dave.  In a nut shell, here are the problem areas in the bill as he 
sees it.  It was a very brief conversation, but I think I've captured the key 
points:
Based on an expectation that the ""expedited siting"" bill would help site 
plants, Dave's group had six plants on the drawing board.

The 5 ppm requirement kills 4 of the 6, i.e., the 4 can't meet the 5 ppm 
requirement.
The requirement that the plants would either be 1) shut down after 3 years or 
2) replaced with a combined-cycle plant kills the other 2 because a) shutting 
down the plants in 3 years kills the economics, and b) the sites for the two 
LM-6000s can't accomodate combined cylces (i.e., Dave couldn't get siting).
In addition,the generator would be required to sign an exclusive with the ISO 
(which the EOB would have to approve), which takes away the optionality of 
going to the market, thus killing the economics.
On the labor side, it's complicated, but in essence, by requiring that ""...it 
be shown that the applicant has a contract with a general contractor and has 
contracted for an adequate supply of skilled labor to construct, operate, and 
maintain the plant,"" 
it forces Dave to negotiate a labor deal before he knows what the project is 
(i.e, before the project has been approved), and,
it effectively prevents Enron from having the option to use internal 
resources (this issue is very specific to Enron; I can explain more if folks 
prefer).

In short, bullets 1-3 would seem to affect both Enron and the market, while 
the last bullet is, according to Dave, very Enron specific.  Point 2 in 
bullet 4, according to Dave is sensitive and should not be made public.

If any questions, let me know.  Bruno has emailed the price cap and the 
""general-funds-to-help-finance-the-cap"" bills, and faxed the siting bill.

	Calif GOP Lawmakers Ask PUC President To Resign 
	
	
	Updated: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 02:14 PM?ET 
	
	? 
	?
	
	
	
	
	LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Assembly Republicans have called for the 
resignation of Loretta Lynch, president of the state's Public Utilities 
Commission, saying they have no confidence that the state's top regulator 
will ""play a constructive role in solving the state's energy crisis."" 
	Assembly Republican Minority Leader Bill Campbell, R-Villa Park, sent a 
letter Tuesday to Gov. Gray Davis on behalf of the Assembly's Republican 
Caucus asking Davis to call for Lynch's resignation. 
	
	
	?
	""With efforts to solve California's energy crisis floundering in the midst of 
unpaid bills, stalled negotiations and rolling blackouts, it has come time to 
ask for the resignation of your appointed president of the California Public 
Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch,"" the letter said. 
	Both Lynch and a spokesman for Davis were unavailable for comment. 
	Lynch, a former attorney, was appointed president of the PUC by Davis in 
March 2000. She is the state's top regulator, in charge of regulating 
utilities, telecommunications, commercial transportation and water companies. 
Before her appointment to the PUC, Lynch was head of Davis's office of 
Planning and Research. 
	The letter says the PUC had a number of opportunities last summer to keep the 
electricity crisis from spiraling out of control by allowing Edison 
International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. 
(PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Sempra Energy (SRE, news, 
msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric to sign long-term power supply contracts 
for about $50 a megawatt-hour, nearly $30 lower than the new long-term 
contracts Davis said the state entered into recently with generators. 
	Lynch's failure to ""ensure that the commission's Aug. 3, 2000, emergency 
order on long-term contracts was quickly implemented has placed the state 
budget at risk for costs now at least 40% higher,"" the letter said. ""This 
hesitancy in a crisis will cost California's economy tens of billions of 
dollars during the next 20 years."" 
	The state has spent more than $3 billion since January buying power in the 
spot market. Davis has asked lawmakers for another $500 million from the 
general fund to continue buying power. If the $500 million is granted, the 
state's commitment to power purchases will surpass $4 billion. 
	State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, however, said last week that the Senate 
Budget Committee will deny further requests for funding unless the PUC carves 
out a revenue stream for the state's Department of Water Resources, the 
agency that is now buying the bulk of the state's power on behalf of the 
cash-strapped utilities. 
	The PUC was expected to release guidelines last week on rates the DWR can 
receive from utilities to pay back the general fund and to issue revenue 
bonds to pay for long-term contracts. But the guidelines haven't yet been 
released. 
	Last year, the PUC said the utilities could enter into limited long-term 
supply contracts to hedge their positions against price spikes. But the 
commission also said it feared if the utilities signed long-term deals with 
generators, liquidity in the wholesale market would be reduced. 
	The Republican lawmakers said the commission is responsible for nearly 
forcing the utilities into bankruptcy. 
	""We have no confidence that Loretta Lynch will play a constructive role in 
solving the energy crisis in the weeks and months ahead,"" the letter said. 
""With Wall Street nervous about repayment of the $10 billion in revenue bonds 
needed to cover the state's energy purchases, the CPUC has been unable to 
perform an adequate assessment of the investor-owned utilities' financial 
situation.""

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to ""obscene"" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Jeff

Subject: WESTERN Regulatory Strategy

Paul, Joe, & Harry --

We've all talked about holding a meeting to outline our strategy for the next 
12 months in the Western states (wholesale and retail) and so I propose the 
following.

1. GA Strategy Meeting

We should come together as just GA before meeting with the business people.  
I think that we want to have the following people in attendance (like your 
input) - Paul Kaufman, Joe Hartsoe, Sarah Novosel, Mary Hain, Marcie Milner, 
Steve Walton, Jim Steffes, Harry Kingerski, Sue Mara, Jeff Dasovich, Bruno 
Gaillard, Mona Petrochko, Sandi McCubbin.

The meeting output would be a Strategy and Tactics Plan for June 2000 - June 
2001.

2. GA meeting w/ Business People

A few of us could go to Belden, Calger, Yang, Benevides, Condon to discuss 
the above.  

I would like to have these meetings soon (maybe Thursday, Sept 7 for #1).

Please let me know.

The Senate has thus far failed to get its version of the ""Edison MOU""

Calif ISO Cuts Power Refund Estimate To $6.1B From $8.9B     
Updated: Wednesday, July 18, 2001 11:53 AM ET      
 

By Mark Golden 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 


NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California's estimate of how much the state was overcharged by power suppliers dropped to $6.1 billion from $8.9 billion when an adjustment requested by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge was taken into account, according to data submitted to FERC last week. 

The California Independent System Operator's estimate fell when the grid operator excluded power bought by utilities not under its purview, and its estimate could fall again as it works in other recommendations made by the judge following the conclusion of 15 days of talks between power suppliers and the state over potential refunds last week. 

Even as the ISO continues to recalculate its refund estimate, however, the state is sticking to the original $8.9 billion figure, which has been called arbitrary by critics. The $6.1 billion estimate merely establishes ""a potential framework for settlement discussions,"" Eric Hildebrandt, the ISO's chief analyst on the matter, told the FERC. 

FERC administrative law judge Curtis Wagner, who has dismissed the $8.9 billion figure as baseless and criticized California's delegation for not negotiating in good faith, estimated in his report on the talks that refunds due may amount to about $1 billion. Power suppliers offered just over $700 million. 

Wagner has recommended FERC hold a 60-day hearing to set the level of refunds and has told the ISO to revise its estimate of what California is owed. 

The ISO's original $8.9 billion figure included electricity sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers that didn't go through the ISO's wholesale markets, the California Power Exchange or the California Department of Water Resources. Without direct knowledge of the prices of those purchases, the ISO made estimates. 

""We know the volume (of the bilateral deals),"" Hildebrandt said. ""The refund amount was based on extrapolation of observed prices in the spot market."" 


Resetting The Baseline 


Wagner told the ISO to recalculate its figure using only sales through the ISO and CalPX markets - which were set up by the state's deregulation law for California's three investor-owned utilities to purchase power - in addition to sales to the California Department of Water Resources. 

The DWR has been buying power for the utilities since PG&E Corp. (PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison ran out of cash in January. DWR has also been covering the needs of Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 

In arriving at his new estimate, the ISO's Hildebrandt also recalculated fair prices - the baseline against which refundable amounts are determined - by retroactively applying the price controls FERC imposed June 19. Those controls set prices by the operating costs of the least efficient generator needed to meet demand each hour. 

But last week, after Hildebrandt completed his $6.1 billion estimate, Wagner recommended to FERC commissioners that the June 19 price control formula be modified when used retroactively to determine refunds. 

Those modifications, if applied to the ISO's estimate, would cut refunds much further. For example, FERC's price limits are now based on a monthly average of natural gas prices covering supplies throughout the state. Wagner recommended using power producers' actual gas costs. Since gas is considerably more expensive in southern California, using actual prices would cut potential refunds sharply. 

Also, Wagner said that refunds should be ordered on sales only as far back as Oct. 2, which would reduce the total amount claimed by California by about one-third, according to Hildebrandt's previous monthly breakdown. 

ISO staff is again recalculating the refund estimate to reflect some of Wagner's recommendations, but the ISO will still include sales back to May 2000, said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. 

""The reason we're not going back just to Oct. 2 is that all of the overcharges going back to May should be repaid,"" McCorkle said. ""We just maintain that position."" 


FERC Baseline Questioned 


In addition, Hildebrandt argues in his recently released estimate that when fair prices are calculated retroactively using FERC's new formula, the price cap should be based on the least efficient generator the ISO knows to have been available, not the least efficient generator actually used to meet demand. 

That's because the FERC's new price controls require all available generators be made available to the ISO at any time, Hildebrandt said. 

Applying that rule would raise the ISO's revised estimate substantially: to $7.7 billion from $6.1 billion. 

One of the ways generators managed to manipulate prices higher, Hildebrandt said, was to not offer cheaper power from more efficient units. Considering only the least efficient generator actually used would make permanent the rewards for such withholding, he said. 

""The judge is in error to suggest that the actual (least-efficient) unit used would have been called on if the must-offer requirement were in effect,"" Hildebrandt said in an interview. 

In arriving at his estimate, Hildebrandt determined the difference between actual sales prices and what prices would have been for every seller and for every hour since May 1, 2000, had price controls been in effect. The ISO released only the total potential refund, not the company-specific shares. 

Hildebrandt took issue with generating companies that have complained his numbers aren't justified. 

""These are based on very tangible records,"" he said. ""The idea that it's a black box is misleading.""

Folks:

My apologies in advance if I vent somewhat.  

Briefly, some of you know that I attended Berkeley's Policy School.  I have 
been very closely involved with the conference Severin describes in his note 
to Littlechild.  I have been working to try to establish a joint venture 
between the policy and business schools at Berkeley to hold an ""energy 
summit,"" where national and international energy leaders would converge on 
California (under the auspices of UC Berkeley) to talk energy policy.  Jim 
Steffes has helped a lot in brainstorming the idea.  In short,, our goal was 
to have a group of prominent folks squarely refute the extremely retrograde 
notions of ""turn the clock back"" that the Governor of California's two most 
recent appointees have been articulating at every opportunity over the past 
several months, and re-seize the agenda in California. The ""energy heads of 
state"" at the summit would come up with solutions for going forward.

The concept (and invitees) that Severin describes is loosely based on 
proposals I have made to the ""steering committee.""  However, for reasons I 
won't bore you with in this note, the effort has frankly turned into a 
fiasco.  I notified the group this week that Enron would not be 
participating, that they should go forward with the conference without us, 
and that I would help somewhat (contacts, etc.) when (and if) they ever came 
to agreement on the agenda and particpants.  From my perspective, the effort 
turned out to be a rather big disappointment.  I urge us not to get involved 
or contribute $$s.  At this juncture I would recommend against having Ken Lay 
participate.  Depending on how the thing shapes up, we may  or may not want 
to have someone at a substantially lower level participate, but I'm 
pessimistic at this point.  If anyone would like to discuss my reasons in 
more detail, I'd be happy to discuss.

I still think the idea of an energy summit is very promising.  But the forum 
that these folks are creating ain't the right one.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to 
include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond 
bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 
17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt 
from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from 
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services 
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it 
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but 
subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by 
DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying 
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only 
be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from 
Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took 
place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the 
talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree 
pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create 
unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include 
very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what 
customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with 
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it 
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to 
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short 
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby 
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity 
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to 
the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches 
to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct 
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that 
seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if 
that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and 
passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal.

In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed ""Petitions for Rehearing.""
The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.
Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.
In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.
Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.  
Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.
The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.
If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.

Best,
Jeff

""We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001.""  pp 20-21",enron_mail/maildir/dasovich-j/sent_items/629,14,17,138,19,6,4,16,16,0,0,279,19,13,71,36,5.10752688172043,34,323,1748,105,154,30

Critics Seek
More Control
Over ISO 
By Marc Lifsher 

08/09/2000 
The Wall Street Journal 
Page CA1 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Some people want the California Independent System Operator to be a lot less 
independent. 
The Folsom-based nonprofit corporation, which acts as the traffic cop for the 
state's electricity grid, has been a lightning rod for criticism during this 
summer's power crisis. Though generally praised for keeping lights on in the 
face of severe shortages of electricity, the ISO has come under fire for 
failing to move more quickly to lower the maximum price it will pay 
generators for emergency power to meet demand and prevent blackouts. 
Pressure on the ISO has eased considerably since last week, when its 
governing board voted to lower the cap on such same-day, emergency purchases 
-- the only type of pricing it has the power to affect directly -- to $250 a 
megawatt hour from $500. But the heat hasn't been turned off completely. Some 
lawmakers still are calling for changes in the 26-member ISO board, which 
includes people nominated by power generators, utilities, middlemen, and 
commercial and residential customers, among others. The critics want to 
streamline the board and make it more accountable to the state's elected 
officials. 
The ISO was created by the state's 1996 utility-deregulation act to transmit 
electricity smoothly between generators and utilities. Lawmakers devised the 
independent board as a way to give the various ""stakeholders"" -- generators, 
utilities, middlemen, customers and environmentalists -- a say in how energy 
is supplied. Members serve for up to three years. 
""It's inappropriate for the ISO governing board to vote on issues that 
benefit them financially,"" says Sen. Dede Alpert, a Coronado Democrat. She 
questions the wisdom of allowing out-of-state energy sellers and marketers to 
sit on the ISO board and vote on emergency prices, especially when they have 
an interest in keeping those prices high. 
Sen. Alpert spent much of the Legislature's recent summer recess fielding 
complaints about high electricity costs from her constituents, customers of 
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy. Last 
summer, SDG&E became the first investor-owned utility in the state to have 
price regulations fully lifted. This summer, its rates have doubled, as high 
temperatures and power shortages have swept the West. 
In response to a series of price spikes in Southern California and the wider 
contention that skyrocketing prices indicate the failure of deregulation, 
state lawmakers have scheduled a joint hearing tomorrow in Sacramento. High 
on the agenda: possible changes in the ISO's governing structure and scrutiny 
of the way it handles power statewide on hot days. Critics say emergency 
purchases should be no more than 5% of electric-power sales, but were as high 
as 33% of the market on hot days earlier this summer. 
Key legislative leaders -- including Sen. Steve Peace, an El Cajon Democrat 
who was the architect of the 1996 deregulation law -- would like to make the 
ISO more accountable to state elected officials. 
Possible changes include preventing industry representatives with conflicts 
from sitting on the ISO board, as well as abolishing the ISO entirely and 
shifting its responsibilities back to state utilities, under the supervision 
of the state Public Utilities Commission. Until 1996, the PUC regulated all 
electric utility rates and services. 
ISO board members say legislative critics are unfairly focusing anger over 
the price spikes on the ISO, which has only a limited ability to set prices. 
Most electricity isn't sold through the same-day, emergency market -- but 
through long-term contracts between sellers and utilities, or at least a day 
in advance through the California Power Exchange, which is a nonprofit 
corporation established by the 1996 law to serve as a trading floor. 
""We need to create a government structure that is not susceptible to pressure 
from one state senator or anyone else,"" to keep prices artificially low, says 
ISO Chairman Jan Smutney-Jones, who represents the Independent Energy 
Producers Association, the trade group for non-utility power generators. He 
dismisses criticism of the board's out-of-state members. There needs to be 
""an independent, interstate board"" because energy is transmitted across state 
lines, he says. Two Houston-based power sellers on the board, Dynegy Corp. 
and Enron Corp., deny any conflict. Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief 
executive, blames state officials for expanding the ISO's role to include 
monitoring prices. ""If there's any finger-pointing,"" Mr. Watson says, ""they 
probably should start with the big finger pointed right at them."" 
Substantial restructuring of ISO governance could prove difficult. The state, 
through the governor-appointed Electricity Oversight Board, has limited power 
to make changes. Past efforts by the Oversight Board to exert control didn't 
go far. 
Last year, state lawmakers tried to give the Oversight Board the power to 
confirm or reject ISO board members to make them accountable to state 
officials. (Nominees had previously gone on automatically.) The effort was 
opposed by officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 
Washington, D.C., which argued that the state couldn't have veto power over 
the nominees of out-of-state power producers. In a compromise, California 
officials were given authority to veto half the board -- those nominated by 
residential, industrial, commercial and agricultural power-users. 
The federal energy commission has final regulatory authority over the ISO and 
has viewed state attempts to meddle with the agency as an unconstitutional 
attempt to hinder interstate commerce. 
Any proposed changes in ISO's governing structure ""would be looked at very 
closely by FERC,"" says ISO attorney Richard Jacobs. 
This summer, the ISO board displayed an independence that was annoying to 
state lawmakers. In June, Sen. Peace called on the board to lower its price 
cap for emergency purchases, from $750 a megawatt hour (roughly the amount of 
electricity needed to power 1,000 homes) to $250. The board responded by 
lowering the cap to $500 a megawatt hour. A second attempt to lower the cap 
to $250 failed to get a majority vote. 
The reason? The three private power-seller representatives, including the 
Independent Energy Producers Association, were joined by those representing 
agricultural, industrial and commercial users in opposing a lowering of the 
cap. 
Then, the pressure on the ISO board really intensified. Gov. Gray Davis 
weighed in, by sending the ISO board a letter asking it to lower the cap ""to 
the lowest possible level."" Energy Secretary Bill Richardson ordered the 
representative of federal-public-power sellers to change his vote from no to 
yes. A consumer representative from the League of Women Voters also moved to 
the ""aye"" column, allowing the cap to be lowered to $250. 
Lowering the cap removes some of the rate pressure on residential and 
commercial consumers in San Diego -- and takes some of the heat off the ISO 
board. But not entirely: A Public Utilities Commission report on the state's 
electricity market that was sent to the governor after the vote said that the 
members of the ISO and the Power Exchange boards ""can have serious conflicts 
of interest"" and that both organization aren't ""accountable to the state or 
its consumers."" 
An ISO spokesman said the board is in the process of producing a formal 
response to the report and it declined to comment. A spokesman for the Power 
Exchange said that it has followed the law regarding conflicts and that it 
does protect consumers.

Dude,
Not seeing (either of) the comments directly, its hard to say what our 
position should be -- Mr. Dasovich, I'll leave that up to your good 
judgment.  However, it would appear that TURN is looking to roll back the 
clock on any progress we might have made in the GIR process to separate 
utility services and make them independently available to the marketplace.  
On that basis, I'd say you've got a reasonable argument to make.  

As far as Transwestern is concerned, I'd say that, as a general matter, we 
oppose any change in regulations that would attempt to repackage or rebundle 
utility services that gives the effect of reducing customer choice.  On the 
other hand, given the backdrop of a frustrated effort in the GIR proceeding, 
as long as they're leaving Hector Road alone, its hard for me to get too 
fired up about anything in California these days.  

Let us know if there is anything you'd like us to do here.  Ours is but to 
serve, my liege.

transactions.  We are haggling about some credit issues, but expect these to 
be resolved shortly.  We participated in their only RFP.   They did not 
transact with us or, to our knowledge, with others. They got cold feet.   We 
work with Jill Horswell, Sean Baker and Bennie Wu.  Since master contracts 
are not done yet, and no deals have been completed, I would say this 
relationship is not as good as PG&E but better than SDG&E.  I would expect 
that we will be doing regular cash business by the end of the year.  They are 
looking at EOL.

SDG&E - We have participated in 3 RFPs and have not been successful.  We have 
been trying to sell them longer dated energy (5 years).  We believe they have 
bought from others but for small size and limited duration.  We work with 
Sharon Firooz.  We have sent them master EEI agreements and are not making as 
much progress in getting them to agree.  They prefer using the  WSPP contract 
rather than EEI.  We hate WSPP.  We will keep pounding on them until they see 
the light but it will likely take longer.  Plus they are far more skittish 
re: longer dated transactions thatn the other utilites.  This said, I would 
be surprised if we were not transacting with them on shorter term deals by Q1 
2001.  They are not using EOL.

Please let me know if this summary meets your needs 503/464-3822.

Six Months Later, Edison's Utility May Still End Up Bankrupt

Greetings.  I have a conflict in the morning, but could join by conference 
calling beginning at 2 pm.  Is that possible.  If not, no big deal.  I, like 
Ralph, will catch up at the next meeting, and submit our ideas to Eve between 
now and then.  Let me know.  And I agree with Ralph re: staying focused on 
the most urgent issues.

Best,
Jeff

Colleagues:  it turns out that at this hour I will be presiding over hearings 
in
Wyoming on the disposal of wastes from nuclear weapons (your condolences are
gratefully accepted).  I hope to join the next meeting, whenever it is.  My
advice remains what I said at our Dec. 1 meeting:  let's try to help the
legislature stay focused for now on the most urgent electricity issues that
absolutely must be addressed now:  forward contracting in the wholesale 
markets
to reduce customers' exposure to very high and volatile wholesale prices, and 
a
rate stabilization plan to deal with the issues surrounding this year's
wholesale costs.  If we can help narrow the immediate issues to those, and 
frame
the differences and decisions that remain, we'll have made a useful
contribution.

They did it!  The jackasses changed the hearing date to Sept 12 as of 3
pm today.  A lady from FERC just called me to let me know.

My suggestion is we cancel our scheduled Board meeting, meet prior to
the 12th, and get our story in line.  Another notice will be published
by FERC regarding participation in the Hearing.

I just copied from the FERC's web page the following notice.  It appears
that FERC will hae a hearing in San Diego, possibly on Friday, Sept 15.
However, an earlier date is equally likely because all four
Commissioners are testifying at a Congressional Hearing in San Diego on
Sept 11.  I guess we need to agendize this for our next meeting, and if
the FERC holds its hearings on Sept 12, we may need to cancel our Board
meeting, and attend this.  I did call the office of External Affairs at
FERC to register WPTF as a speaker.  They were clueless, but promised to
call me back.

                            (September 1, 2000)

          On September 15, 2000, the Federal Energy Regulatory
     Commission is planning to convene a public meeting in San Diego,
     California to allow interested persons to give the Commission
     their views on recent events in California's wholesale markets.
     While the Commission is finalizing arrangements for a meeting on
     September 15th, the Commission may need to change the meeting to
     a different date within the week of September 11th.  A further
     notice will be issued confirming the date.  The meeting is
     scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m., at the San Diego Concourse, the
     Copper Room, 202 C Street, San Diego, California 92101.  All
     interested persons may attend the meeting.  The meeting will be
     transcribed.  A separate notice will be issued before the
     meeting, setting forth an agenda and identifying the panels of
     participants.   Additional information may be obtained from the
     Office of External Affairs at (202) 208-0870.  Information also
     may be obtained from the Commission's web page at
     www.ferc.fed.us.

Thanks.  These are the portions of the deal that I've been highlighting as 
problematic for us with the settlement group for  the past few weeks.  The 
group knows that unless there's some compromise on these points in a way that 
directly addresses our concerns, we won't be signing anything.  After 
yesterday's call, at which Edison blew the meeting up, there's no deal in 
sight in the immediate term.

If this settlement discussion is close to possible we should immediately 
starting switching customers to standard offer.  Scott

Other comments: 

This would be the critical excerpts for us:

Upon termination by a customer of the utility commitment in favor of a direct 
access arrangement, a customer could not return to the utility portfolio, 
except on a spot-price basis, for a period of [one year]; accommodations 
would be made for customers abandoned by direct access providers with no 
market alternatives.

(2) Large customers would be required to commit to a minimum service term of 
[12-36 months]; discontinuing service prior to the end of the committed term 
to engage in a direct access transaction with another supplier would result 
in a true-up of the price paid by the customer and the actual portfolio price 
during the term.

These comments are applicable:
The first term would be okay if it does not change to limit us from switching 
back to utility because we have been off for one year.  The issues is whether 
the one year terms is notice or elapsed time.  This suggests time is of the 
essense in switching back to standard offer.
The 2nd term would be okay but 12 would be a lot better than 36.  And 24 is 
pretty good too. 36 is better than a kick in the head.

And a principle that, 
DA customers would have access to the existing generation, at cost, the same 
as all other industrials, should be added.

We should not sign off on this solution (if they are seeking it) unless we 
have the option to switch back to standard offer.

Attached is a memo that reponds to your question:  ""Can the solution to the 
utilities' undecollection problem take place at the PUC, or is a legislative 
fix required?""  As we discussed, I'm also attaching a memo from Mike Day on 
the issue.  

Bottom line:  It's within the PUC's jurisdiction to solve the problem, but 
the likelihood is high that it will be a key focus of the Legislature in the 
next session.  If you, or anyone on the distribution, have any questions, let 
me know.

Regarding our California strategy, preventing the merger would seem to be 
right up there with ""end the price caps"" in our list of priorities.  At 
today's FERC hearing, a hair-brained consumer advocate called for merging the 
PX and the ISO.  During the panel I was on, I made the point that a merger 
would make California's problems worse than they are today.  The FERC 
Commissioners seemed somewhat responsive to my concerns.
P.S. After the panel, Heber lobbied me hard to support transcos.
DJ Freeman Sees Cal/ISO, PX Merger, Lower Price Cap 
Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

By Jason Leopold 
     Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
     SAN DIEGO (Dow Jones) -- David Freeman, seen a likely replacement for 
Marcie Edwards on the board of governors of the California Independent System 
Operator, said his first order of business would be to try and merge the ISO 
and the California Power Exchange. 
     Edwards resigned her post on the ISO Thursday. 
     An informal consensus among the board has already approved his 
membership. 
     Freeman told Dow Jones Newswires that the $250 per megawatthour 
wholesale power price cap in California is too high, and that he would like 
to see it reduced below $100/MWh. 
     ""I think my role (on the board) will help the state solve it's serious 
generation shortage problem,"" Freeman said. 
     Some market participants said Freeman is expected to run for chair of 
the ISO's board of governors, a seat currently held by Jan Smutny-Jones. 
     The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has this summer been able 
to sell the ISO power in the real time market, and make a great profit for 
itself in return.

Folks-
Ok, here is the plan. We need to draft language on the following issues
(including all the options under each of the issues) that were included in
our Roadmap Document:

Direct Access
Large Customer Utility Service options
Rate Relief
Customer Specific Generation
Renewable Energy

These are the pieces that are NOT covered in other plans, documents, etc. We
need to have the language completed no later than Monday 7/9 at 5:00pm.

I am open to suggestions on how best to handle the work -- maybe assigning
the topics above to folks and then getting together to refine and finalize a
work product? If everyone thinks this is a plan that can work and if there
is a specific topic you would like to tackle please let me know. I would
propose meeting on Sunday at say 3:00 at Mike Kahl's office if that meets
with everyone's approval.


Thanks,

Thanks Roger.  Here are the highlights of today's hearings:

 Common themes--many tracked ours pretty closely
Not a question of whether rates need to rise, but by how much.
Though some oppose any and all rate increases, the lion's share acknowledged 
that the utilities have a cash flow problem and the a rate increase is 
necessary.
Due process matters. 
If the Commission is thinking about going as far as ending rate freezes and 
increasing rates, it better provide for ample due process, or countless law 
suits will ensue.
Don't jump the gun.  
A rate increase is likely, but only the utilities benefit from adoption of 
the utilities' proposals. The Commission needs to carefully scrutinize the 
utilities' claims and take a careful look at the level of increase required 
to maintain access to capital markets.  However, as expected, the utilities 
implored the Commission to jump the gun immediately.  The utilities want the 
Commission to declare an end to the rate freeze and raise rates on Jan.4.
No more divestiture.  
The utility should keep the generating assets it retained, but the Commission 
should ensure that the assets' benefits are allocated equally among all 
customers.  One legislator recommended that the State buy the utilities' 
hydro assets, which would give the utilities the cash they need and give the 
state control over some generation.
Treat all customers equally and fairly.
The Commission should not create two classes of customers (e.g., large v. 
small; direct access v. bundled).  No customer group should be sacrificied to 
save another.
Be as narrow as possible/do as little harm as possible
The immediate problem is the utility's cash/credit crunch.  As such, the 
Commission should do only enough to solve this very specific, immediate 
problem.  A modest rate increase is all that's required and the Commission 
should do no more.

At the beginning and the end of the hearing, the President of the Commission 
asked parties to be prepared (at tomorrow's hearing) to discuss whether the 
Commission could legally use its other, broad powers to raise rates without 
declaring an end to the rate freeze.  It seems that she seems some benefit in 
raising rates, but leaving AB 1890 otherwise intact untill the Commission can 

Marketers and generators are to blame for the problem
Though not universally embraced, the theme came up repeatedly. 

A few parties (e.g., the Unions, low income consumer groups, one PUC 
commissioner) called for complete re-regulation of the industry, returning 
the utilities to vertically integrated monopolies.  But they were the 
exception rather than the rule at today's hearing.

2. Next steps
There hearings were scheduled to end on Thursay, but now will continue 
through Friday.
Tomorrow, lawyers will provide ""oral"" arguments on whether the Commission 
must end the rate freeze in order to increase rates.  We will argue that it 
does not have to, and should not, go through the complex and controversial 
exercise of determing whether the rate freeze is over between now and 
01.04.01.  We will argue that the Commission has the authority to raise rates 
without ending the rate freeze, and if it decides to raise rates, it should 
do so while keeping AB 1890's basic structure in place until a full and fair 
hearing of the issues is completed.   We are talking to other stakeholders to 
persuade them to take the same approach.  In terms of legal arguments, this 
is clearly a long shot, but one that seems worth taking.
After the oral argument, the utilities will present their rate proposals and 
""all interested persons"" will have the opportunity to cross-examine the 
utilities (in short, tomorrow will also be a zoo).
When asked what the process will be for issuing a proposed decision and 
providing comments, the President of the Commission responded ""we don't know, 
it's evolving.""  In other words, the Commission is doing a poor job of 
ensuring that their Jan 4 decision is ""appeal-proof.""
Keep in mind that the situation remains extremely fluid and the trend is 
still toward ending the rate freeze on Jan. 4th.  We continue to aggressively 
offer alternatives to that possibility and continue to try to bring other 
stakeholders to our side.
We're doing everything necessary to preserve our appeal rights.

We can discuss further on the 10 AM (CST) call tomorrow.

Best,
Jeff

Got an update from Jeff Dasovich.  No earth shattering news.  Comments have 
been all over the place.  The impression is being made by differing parties 
that the issues are very complex and would inevitably result in endless 
lawsuits.  Possible conclusion by the CPUC may be to invoke emergency powers 
to implement an emergency surcharge and avoid addressing the issue of when 
the rate freeze ends in these hearings.  However, this is just speculation.  
Jeff will return to the office by 5:00 pm PST and will send out a summary of 
today's hearings.

Attached is a rough draft of my talking points for a panel I'll be on at a 
CEM conference in SF on Thursday afternoon.  Have distributed to Western GA 
team (plus Steffes) for comment and thought you may have some, too.  

Topic for panel, ""PUC Priorities.""  Goal is to (politely?) refute Loretta 
Lynch's and Carl Woods' continued assertions that 1) California's move to 
deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 2) the 
solution is to turn back the clock to command-and-control regulation.  

The FERC order tomorrow is likely to alter the points somewhat.  

Comments are much appreciated.

State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected 
Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests 
Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Friday, March 16, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 

Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying 
electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential 
document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle. 
State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging 
$49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers 
figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests. 
The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources, 
which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of 
lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom 
Hannigan. 
To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much 
California is spending on power purchases. 
Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed, 
it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw 
it. 
""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R- 
Redding. 
Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity, 
analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could 
jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term. 
For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education 
programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst 
warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in 
Davis' proposed budget. 
Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit 
rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the 
utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a 
credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans 
to rise. 
""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive 
director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that 
tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the 
energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look 
like in the future."" 
The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent 
nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest 
day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per 
megawatt hour. 
Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison & 
Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices. 
""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he 
said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be."" 
The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the 
state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if 
generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could 
force up the price the next day. 
But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right 
to know how its money way being spent. 
""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he 
said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces."" 
Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have 
filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state 
has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by 
Davis. 
The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated 
only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if 
needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has 
sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional 
money was needed. 
Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5 
billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending 
$43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water 
Resources document. 
Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has 
become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a 
house of cards. 
The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is 
supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds. The bonds will 
be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every 
month.

Gray Davis is offering rebates for Californians who save on power starting in 
June, and if you've got a strategy for conserving, The Chronicle wants to

This is a very good, easily digestible summary of the FERC order.  Alan 
Zaremberg, CEO of the Chamber and located in Sacramento, asked if we had a

California understands what FERC did and wanted to try to educate them.  If 
we sanitize it to remove anything sensitive, are folks comfortable providing

As you may be aware SoCal Edison has announced their intention to sell their 
interest in the Mohave Generating Station to AES. Would you know if SCE has 
to file for approval of this transaction with the CPUC? I looked on the CPUC 
website but couldn't find a docket/proceeding number. As the operator of the 
Black Mesa slurry line we have a vested interest in this and I may want to 
file as an interested party in the CPUC proceeding. Thanks.

The notion that it would have to be a monthly analysis sounds like pure 
Roger, and could likely be correct.  But we need to determine whether we can 
get what we need by doing a ""less precise"" annual versus a ""monthly.""  Seems 
that once we've made that call, we direct the scenario and they do it.  
Thoughts?

FYI.  Attached is a presentation on gas markets that I gave to an electricity 
group yesterday.  The group was formed out of California's restructuring 
legislation (AB 1980).  It's called the ""AB 1980 Implementation Group"" (I 
heard that the group decided that its time to change its name.).  The group 
includes just about all of the interest groups in California.  

I focused on the fact that gas offers a model of a ""real"" market that 
California should look to in order to fix the ""artificial"" and failed 
electricity model created by AB 1980.

STRANGOZZI WITH BLACK TRUFFLE
Ingredients (4 people): 
500 g of fresh hand-made strangozze, 150 g of black valuable truffle, 
extra-virgin olive oil, garlic, sat, black pepper and parsley. br> 
Preparation: 
Fry slightly the extra-virgin oil, the garlic and some parsley. Take the pan 
off from the stove, filter the spices and mix the other oil with the grated 
truffle seasoned with salt and black pepper. The pasta must be ""al dente"". 
Pour the sauce on the pasta and mix it on the stove at light heat for a 
while, then serve it guarnished with truffles slices. 



		The TRUFFLE
history of a typical umbrian product 

For a lot of people, the word truffle recalls a tuberous entity, marbled on 
the skin, with a nice scent, tasting delicious and it is usually associated 
to a good lunch, generously wet by sweet wine; for the botanics, instead, 
this is just the fruit spreading device of mushrooms wich adapted living in 
the underground. 
Since from the beginning truffles interested philosophers and scientists, 
starting fighting and discussions to whom neither very strict thinkers like 
Savonarola could avoid to partecipate. 
It is not so strange then that in the first book scientifically talking about 
mushrooms which has been printed, the Opusculus de Tuberis di Alfonso 
Ceccarelli da Bevagna (1564), was about TRUFFLES. Almost 2000 years before 
the Greek philosopher Teophrastus (370-287 a.C.) turned on the discussion 
asserting that truffles were vegetables without roots, originated during 
winter rains, if there were thunders. Strange theory, without doubts. The 
Romans were really crazy for truffles and the Latin poets Apicious and 
Giovenal glorified the truffles and their taste, writing also a recipes book. 
During the middle age it was the king on the refined tables of every king's 
court. In a document from Baron A. Ancaiani (1761) about the ""active and 
passive commerce of the town of Spoleto"" huge quantities of truffles sent to 
Florence and Venice are described. It seems they were really requested. 
Rossini defined it the Mozart of the kitchen and it is told that Napoleon 
used huge quantities of the truffle to provide a successor to his kingdom. 
About its botanic constitution, instead, until the late 18th century the 
strangest theories continued to be produced. The celeber naturalist Plinio il 
vecchio considered them as they were ground corns and a miracle. 
Bornolz (1780) thought they were an intermediate class between the animal and 
the vegetal kingdoms. Revel, in 1857, said the truffles were the result of a 
fly bite on a oak root. 
Just after the second half of 18th century the idea that the truffles were 
autonomous organisms, or better mushrooms, started to be accepted. Our Umbria 
keeps a rich ipogeous flora and since centuries is the first country in 
producing truffles, especially the valuable black truffle (Tuber melanosporum 
Vitt.) spread around the woods around Norcia and Spoleto. The mushroom has 
always different dimensions and it can vary from the width of a nut to that 
of an orange and it is very appreciated for the intensity of the smell and 
the rich taste. The collecting of the tubers happens during the time between 
December and March. Secondary is, in these same zones, the production of 
white truffle (Tuber Magnatum Pico) foun in Spoleto nearby valleys, but 
impressive is the production of summer ""scorzone"" truffle (Tuber aestivum 
Vitt.) and even of the ""hooked"" truffle (Tuber uncinatum Ch?teau), which have 
a peculiar taste and smell. 
what truffles are

With the name truffle are designed mushrooms belonging to the order of 
tuberales (Ascomycetes), because the mushrooms have a vegetal body formed by 
a white mold (micelius), constituted by thousand of very thin filaments 
(ife). This mold lives deep into the ground and it physically unites to the 
roots of several plants, originating a very peculiar symbiosis called 
""micorriza"". 
When the ecolocical conditions are fine, the micelius generates the fructifer 
bodies which are formed in a variable range of 40-50 cm. deep in the ground. 
They are tuber-like shaped, or sheroidal or irregular and they are about 1 to 
15 cm. long. The body is made by an internal substance called ""gleba"" in 
which you can distinguish the fertile zones (darker) which carry the ""aschi"", 
a peculiar kind of spore, and in which the spores (the vehicles of diffusion 
for this organisms) mature, and the sterile zones (lighter) which surround 
the fertile zones, originating in the most evolved species a characteristic 
venation system. The ""gleba"" is protected on the outside by a variable 
cortical layer called ""peridio"", inseparable from the ""gleba"". The ""peridio"" 
could have its surface smooth or rough or even warted. The color could be 
white, yellow-like, rusty, brown or blackish. These mushrooms have several 
different species (about 30 in Europe) distributed in all the continents. The 
valuable edible species, however, are very limited. 
chemical composition and nutritive value 

In order to give some information about the nutritive value of this mushroom, 
two species of truffles have been examinated: rtuber melanosporum Vitt._ 
(valuable black truffle from Norcia or Spoleto) and rtuber magnatum Pico_ 
(valuable white truffle from Piemonte or Acqualagna). The valuable black 
truffle has been found in the Quercus Pubescens tartufaia in january. The 
white one has been found close to Citt. di Castello (High Tiber valley) in 
Populus Nigra tartufaia in November. These two different species of truffle 
are not so different about their chemical composition. The proteins are the 
main nutrient component for the metabolism: they are complete and rich, above 
all of lisyn, cystin and metionin, and they are very digestible. Even the 
minaral composition is great. The fat are essentially unsaturated and the 
most important is the linoleic acid. It is pretty relevant the fiber content. 
how to wash truffles

Before you can use truffles, you must gently clean it from the ground with a 
soft brush, in order to eliminate all the ground particles. It is 
suggestible, before starting the operation, to keep them under warm water for 
a couple of minutes. This will help the ground to fall from the space between 
the wrinkles. The skin is edible and it must be ate excactly as the rest of 
the truffle, and it is very aromatic and tasty. 
how to preserve truffles

Once it has been found in a good condition, it is important to process the 
tuber as soon as possible, because it is very easy for it to decay and lose 
its aromatic flavour. The soulution to this problem should be left to the 
specialized companies. Sometimes, however, you must do it by yourself, so 
here are some advice: before all don't remove the ground from the cracks 
because it will just accelerate the decaying process, but roll every truffle 
in a napkin and put it in a can or a jar, in the less cold part of your 
refrigerator. The paper must be changed every day. This procedure will allow 
you to save fresh truffles for about 5-6 days for the white one and for 10 
days the black one. you can even save the truffles in a can containing rice, 
but this is not very smart, because you dry the tuber, taking the air off of 
it and helping the decaying. Another sytem is to deep fry the truffles in the 
oil, obtaining a sauce you can save in the refrigerator for about a month. Or 
you can crush it, if black, or slice it, if white, and then mix it with 
creamy butter and add some salt. Then you shape it as a brick or tube, as you 
like. Every time you would like to add to a dish the truffle aroma, you can 
just add a small flake of this valuable truffled butter, resting in the 
refrigerator. It is better to use the butter within a month from its 
preparation. 
truffles in cuisine
keep always in mind that:
a black truffle must never be grated or crushed in a mortar; 
it must never be cooked or too warm; 
never mix truffle and cheese; 
always use extra-virgin olive oil and salt; 
use it in dishes which are not alredy very flavoured (Ex. with boiled or 
grilled lake fish, with boiled or grilled poultry and so on.) ",enron_mail/maildir/dasovich-j/sent/4214,8,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1390,70,133,156,113,4.684172661870504,147,1738,8247,598,621,50

Talked to Mark.

First thing he has to do is convince Davis' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.
He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.
I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.
He said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office.
He's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting.
I'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting?
I asked him what sort of deals they're working on. As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.  So they're looking to get ""soup-to-nuts"" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.

PG&E's $2 Billion Power Grab
We've been gulled by our greedy utility 
Ken Garcia
Thursday,?September 14, 2000 
,2000 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/09/14/T
Z110687.DTL 
SAN FRANCISC -- The executives at Pacific Gas and Electric Co. sure try hard 
to live up to their name, because I can't think of any company that has been 
more adept at giving consumers a jolt. 
The doyens of greed that rule over the California utility giant recently 
revealed that they hope to pass on to customers more than $2 billion in 
expenses -- ``unforeseen costs'' in the euphemistic view of the power 
company, but unjustifiable rate increases to those of us residing in real 
world. 
The consumer-soaking surge is apparently based on PG&E's inability to predict 
a rise in wholesale electricity prices, which is costing the company about 
$700 million a month. Yet, as usual, the utility giant wants us to forget all 
past promises and obligations, a favorite technique of energy merchants who 
see rate increases as something that can be turned on with the flick of a 
switch. 
Lest anyone forget, a utility rate increase is exactly what California's 
customers were told they would not get as a result of a deregulated power 
market, which was supposed to lower -- not raise -- energy bills because of 
an expected increase in competition. 
It shouldn't come as a surprise that our friends at PG&E were among the prime 
architects of the state's deregulation policy, which they now want to bend in 
their financial favor. This is known as having your cake and (billing) Edith 
too, because certainly she and her fellow customers wouldn't want the utility 
company's stock to fall. 
Now, I realize PG&E has been prone to blackouts over the years, but just 
because it doesn't like the deal it forged and signed a few years back, 
doesn't mean that its customers should be forced to pay for its lapses in 
judgment. If you want to dance, you have to pay the fiddler -- even if it 
turns out to be Nero and the electrical lines are burning. 
``It should be PG&E that eats the costs because they made the initial promise 
that rates would go down,'' Dan Jacobson of the California Public Interest 
Research Group told The Chronicle the other day. And he's right, even if the 
state Public Utilities Commission once again buckles under and decides to 
give PG&E a break it doesn't deserve. 
While PG&E CEO Robert Glynn was trying to assuage analysts on Wall Street 
this week that the soaring electricity rates would indeed be passed on to 
customers, The Chronicle revealed that the state Board of Equalization has 
quietly been granting utilities and giant corporations billions of dollars in 
tax breaks. Despite a booming economy, the state agency has inexplicably 
reduced the property tax assessments of PG&E, Pacific Bell and others to the 
tune of $5.3 billion in the past year alone. 
That's a lot of lost kilowatts and phone calls that could be used by 
California residents. But in the world of utilities, it's always best to 
leave the consumer in the dark. 
In effect, the equalization board is improperly granting huge tax breaks to 
companies worth billions, at the same time its assessments on homes and small 
commercial properties are skyrocketing. And if you think something smells a 
little rotten here -- well, it may just be the smoke rising from a lot of 
consumers' ears. 
You don't have to look far to see why officials at PG&E are feeling a little 
desperate in their attempts to pass along their rising costs to consumers as 
quickly as possible. Because the faster they can do it, the faster customers 
might forget that PG&E had asked the PUC for an $800 million rate increase 
earlier this year to help keep the lights in the corporate tower burning. 
The utility was granted a $450 million increase, even though an 
administrative law judge found that the company needed only half that amount 
to meet its expenses. But what's a few hundred million between friends? 
Yet the funny part is, PG&E officials said that rate increase would actually 
lower our gas and electric bills, an event that happens on our shores about 
as often as a tsunami. This energy-defying trick, which I first questioned in 
February, would take place, we were told, because of cost savings within the 
utility giant's other divisions. Yet if they were making more money, why did 
PG&E need the PUC to give it close to a half billion in bill increases? 
Well, the answer is that it would appear there are quite a few dim bulbs 
making decisions about California's energy market, and Gov. Gray Davis hasn't 
seen fit to replace them. 
So don't be shocked if PG&E again gets its way, and once again customers are 
``serviced'' by state regulators to the tune of hundreds of millions in rate 
increases, no matter how unfair or undeserved. PG&E said it would foot the 
bill when it pushed for deregulation, and now that it's taking a huge hit for 
past decisions, it wants to pass the buck. 
It takes time to build up a reputation for Power, Greed & Excess. Energy 
companies, after all, are anything but utilitarian.

State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected 
Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests 
Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Friday, March 16, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 

Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying 
electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential 
document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle. 
State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging 
$49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers 
figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests. 
The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources, 
which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of 
lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom 
Hannigan. 
To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much 
California is spending on power purchases. 
Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed, 
it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw 
it. 
""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R- 
Redding. 
Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity, 
analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could 
jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term. 
For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education 
programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst 
warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in 
Davis' proposed budget. 
Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit 
rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the 
utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a 
credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans 
to rise. 
""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive 
director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that 
tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the 
energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look 
like in the future."" 
The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent 
nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest 
day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per 
megawatt hour. 
Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison & 
Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices. 
""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he 
said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be."" 
The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the 
state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if 
generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could 
force up the price the next day. 
But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right 
to know how its money way being spent. 
""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he 
said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces."" 
Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have 
filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state 
has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by 
Davis. 
The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated 
only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if 
needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has 
sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional 
money was needed. 
Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5 
billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending 
$43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water 
Resources document. 
Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has 
become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a 
house of cards. 
The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is 
supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds. The bonds will 
be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every 
month.

Tell Us What You Think Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage? Gov. 
Gray Davis is offering rebates for Californians who save on power starting in 
June, and if you've got a strategy for conserving, The Chronicle wants to 
hear it. Contact the Energy Desk, San Francisco Chronicle, 901 Mission St.,

Thanks, Cynthia.  Extreme rhetoric likely from Ms Lynch, CPUC Prez, UCAN and 
Sempra chief (Steve Baum).  Rest of panel looking pretty good.  Might be 
useful to let Smutney do at least the lion's share of the ""responding"" to Ms 
Lynch's and Mr. Baum's rabid attacks on generators.  Smutney's had a lot of 
practice in the last couple of months and he's close to the issue.  But, of 
course, a few well placed jabs, couldn't hurt....

Subject: Phone Calls w/Large Customers re: Core/Noncore Proposal

I've had several phone calls with large customer groups over the past 
24-hours, mostly explaining our noncore/core proposal (in contrast to the one 
that the Assembly Democrats have launched which would saddle business with 
100% of the utilities' past debts).  As folks know, the cost shift provision 
of the Dems plans have been erroneously attributed to us in some cases.

The business folks have been very appreciative of the discussions and have 
recognized that, generally, our proposal is a fair and reasonable one.  They 
are going to try to set up direct negotiations with Hertzberg and have 
requested that I be part of those negotiations.  They are not sure that 
Hertzberg will go along with the idea, but they're going to try.  They will 
get back to me when they find out.  I'll report back soon as I hear something.

I'll be in the office very shortly.  My converstation with Fielder (SCE SVP I've been talking to about the PX credit) yesterday afternoon regarding the settlement was not very fulfilling:
 

he said there's still disagreement about what they owe us for the PX credit
he made a point to include in our conversation the provision in the settlement that requires Edison to ""cooperate"" with the AG and the PUC in litigation against generators/marketers

I told him that we needed to get the payment issue resolved very quickly.  He said that they needed a day or two to regroup and that they intended to call each and every creditor to discuss next steps.

Greetings all:
I'l have the financials and any other comments/suggestions done and sent to
all this evening.  I have a conference call at 7 am tomorrow.  Apologies.
But I think it's very important that we get together one last time to
ensure that we're all on the same page, that folks understand clearly what
slides they're responsible for presenting, etc.  What about lunch tomorrow
(we're all in the city), or at 5 PM (before the ball game)?  Lemme know.

Best,
Jeff

I do not have everything yet.  Still need info from Anil and Jeff with all
the
numbers.  Carolyn, would you mind condensing into 2 slides a summary of the
acquisition events.  Similar to all the slides you have already done but
just
condensed.  I think that would be it.

Wednesday morning works for me.  I'm going to a Giants game in the evening.

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Bizarre as it sounds, we've now heard that they are calling the Assembly 
members back.  So it appears that the Assembly leadership will at least make 
a run at this.  We are getting more information and mobilizing industry.  
Some key considerations:

The Governor is putting immense pressure on the Legislature to get something 
done.
The Legislature is fearful of getting blamed by the Governor for having ""done 
nothing.""
Becauase the Assembly has thus far ""done nothing,"" the only thing it has in 
front of it is 78.
The Assembly could not agree to the Speaker's bill because it felt the bill 
was too far to the left; but 78 is even more one-sided. So there's a 
reasonable likelihood that 78 would have to be amended considerably in order 
to get the support necessary to get voted out.
Once voted out of the Assembly, it would have to go back to the Senate, where 
the Senate would have to approve it.
Again, the Senate has adjourned, so Burton would have to round them up and 
call them back for a vote, and there's no indication at this time that 
Burton's inclined to come back.
In addition, Burton has said that he's not interested in making any changes 
to 78, that ""it's 78 or nothing.""  Consequently, for the Sentate (i.e., 
Burton) to vote it out, it would first have to agree to the Assembly's 
amendments.  Thus far, the Assembly and the Senate have not seen eye to eye 
on the issues.
All that said, this Legislature is far from rational, and nothing can be 
counted out.  We're therefore operating under the assumption that 78 could 
move. 
Will report back as information becomes available.
Best,
Jeff

     I chuckled to read about Dan being the center of Dante's Inferno core,
but quickly was overcome more by disdain of the simpleton Mr. Palast's
wretched journalistic license.  Why don't you get Skillings, Michaels,
McCrae, Levin et al to answer all the preposterous revisionist pablum that
is saturating the marketplace as we speak?  Is there or was there only one
Jessie Knight who lived that 6-year hell to have crap like this spread
about?  Where are all the direct access/bilateral
contract/anti-poolco/anti-Hogan/anti-Harvard Electricity Group/anti-command
& control proponents?  It is sad for me to hear the deafening silence out of
a community that I helped lead to battle and to leave and see that most have
abandoned the cause to leave it the world to the government infidels that
want to and will certainly re-create the Gulag.

Carolyn:

I wanted to apologize for the way the group dynamic has shaped up.  It's 
clear to me that you're a bit frustrated, and if I've contributed, I 
apologize.  

You've done the most work on this project, your contribution has been very 
significant, and I personally am not satisfied about the way that the stuff 
you've pulled together (and your views) have been included.  At some point, 
though, it gets tough beating one's head against the wall.  Seems to me that, 
in a group, everyone should have some of their views included---that's what 
groups and compromises are all about.  After all, it's school.  We've made a 
lot of sacrifices to do it, and the point is to learn.

Anyway, I hope you'll still comment on the presentation, and I'm glad that 
you've agreed to do part of it on Thursday.  For my part, I felt that I 
pushed yesterday about as much as I'm prepared to push and at this point, 
I'll put the ratios tables together, offer a few edits, buy don' t see much 
use going to the mat.

Overall, I think it'll be an okay presentation, though getting there has 
been, well, bumpy.

But thanks very much for all the work you did.  It was important, and the 
presentation is better off for it.

Institute, will host a meeting of industry representatives, policy makers,
consumers representatives, legislators and researchers to discuss the
electricity restructuring experience and potential solutions to the
difficulties that California and other governments have encountered.  The
summit will run from 12:30-6pm with two roundtable discussions that will
include a wide variety of viewpoints.

You're right, Sue.  Rates can't go up w/out declaring the rate freeze over in 
some fashion---trying to finesse it.  Thanks very much for the comments.  
Harry also had a good comment---don't specify the amount of rate increase in 
our comments; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well-reasoned 
and based on facts and evidence.  Will make that change.

Jeff,

This looks good.  It comes across as moderate in tone-- although probably no 
one else will ask to leave the rate freeze in place. 

I have a legal question -- Under AB 1890, I don't see anyway that the CPUC 
can raise rates without ending the rate freeze first.  Am I missing 
something? So, how is it clear that the CCPUC can raise the rates on Feb 1?  
It's clear,however,  that once the retained assets are valued that the rates 
can be changed.

Energy Firms' Mixed Message Is Focus of Inquiry 

Deregulation: Senate panel will investigate whether suppliers were being 
misleading when they promised lower rates for consumers while they were also 
predicting bigger profits for investors. 

By ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers 

In the summer of 1999, a top official with a major player in California's 
power market testified during a congressional committee hearing in support of 
speeding up deregulation. Unleashing market forces, said the Dynegy Inc. 
executive, would ensure ""maximum customer savings"" and ""low-cost power."" 
That same month, the Houston-based firm made a far different pitch to Wall 
Street: Deregulation and major swings in electricity prices would boost 
revenue and stock value. ""We know how to take advantage of volatility spikes 
across the gas and power market,"" Chief Executive Officer Charles Watson 
declared in a publication targeting large investors. ""The energy 
marketplace,"" he predicted, ""will simply get more volatile."" 
Dynegy was not alone, a review of federal filings, company documents and 
public records shows. In the years since California's pioneering deregulation 
plan was approved, other major out-of-state energy suppliers were sending 
similar, seemingly contradictory signals to the public and stock buyers.
Now, those divergent messages--electricity prices will fall but corporate 
revenue and profits will climb--will be a key focus of a special state Senate 
committee charged with investigating the alleged manipulation in the power 
market.
""How you can tell your investors you're about to make a whole ton of money in 
the very short term, and tell the consumers of California you're about to get 
lower rates?"" said Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), a former consumer attorney 
who is heading the legislative probe. 
Investigations by the state attorney general and federal regulators are 
continuing, but remain largely secret.
The Senate panel could offer the most open and wide-ranging examination yet 
of alleged misconduct among power sellers. The bipartisan panel expects to 
begin requesting documents from power producers as early as today and begin 
hearings in a few weeks. Committee members stress that they are hoping the 
power companies will cooperate but are ready to issue subpoenas if necessary.

Suppliers Deny Misleading Public
The legislative probe comes as many state officials are moving aggressively 
to expose alleged market manipulation and overcharges totaling billions of 
dollars by the power suppliers.
""Somewhere along the line, there may be a skunk in the woodpile. And if there 
is, we need to find out about it,"" said K. Maurice Johannessen (R-Redding), 
the committee's ranking Republican.
Another panel member, Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), noted that all 
companies try to maximize profits. ""But [we want] to understand how the 
market was manipulated and how sellers took advantage of the market.""
The power traders strongly deny acting improperly or sending misleading 
signals to the public.
""Hogwash,"" said Tom Williams, spokesman for North Carolina-based Duke Energy. 
Spokesmen for Dynegy said there was nothing inconsistent in the statements of 
their executives.
The companies maintain that California's problems stem from soaring 
electricity demand, lagging power plant construction and a faulty 
deregulation plan adopted by the Legislature in 1996. ""You have a flawed 
structure there,"" said Dynegy spokesman John Sousa.
Sousa and executives of other power suppliers say their comments to the 
general public and to Wall Street are not contradictory because unfettered 
competition--not the California model--would have created opportunities to 
both make money and cut rates.
Still, regulators, lawmakers and ratepayer groups note that only half the 
promises made by the power dealers have been realized so far--their earnings 
and stock prices have risen at record rates as electricity prices have soared.
""The big lie was, while they were telling ratepayers to 'Trust us, we're 
going to lower your rates,' they were planning the entire time to raise the 
rates,"" said San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre, a former federal prosecutor 
who specialized in fraud cases. Aguirre is representing state ratepayers in a 
class-action lawsuit against the power companies.
Just last month, California's independent grid operator reported that many 
power sellers ""used well-planned strategies to ensure maximum possible 
prices."" Potential overcharges could total nearly $6.3 billion. 
The Senate panel wants to track information that Dynegy and other generators 
were providing to the investment community in the 1990s as a possible way of 
determining whether they entered the California market with plans to run up 
electricity costs. Among many other things, the committee plans to seek 
internal projections of how the firms expected wholesale prices and profits 
to rise under deregulation. 
Members also want to know how the suppliers expected to recoup billions in 
outlays for California power plants being unloaded by regulated utilities. 
Some of the purchases were far above book value, stunning analysts.
""What did they know that the rest of us didn't at the time they were 
purchasing those generations facilities?"" asked Dunn. ""They knew something.""
One thing the power wholesalers say they did know was that tight power 
supplies in California would probably boost prices, at least for a time.
""They were going anywhere where they thought energy [use] would spike 
upward,"" recalled market analyst Joan Goodman, who was familiar with company 
pitches. ""California was one of those places because it didn't have 
sufficient [power] plants.""
Duke Energy projected that prices would rise after 2000, although the company 
says it did not foresee the huge increases that occurred, according to 
spokesman Williams.
However, when the company sealed one of the first packages of power plant 
purchases in the state in 1997, Chief Executive Officer Richard Priory said 
in a press release it would ""deliver greater value"" to California customers.
The publicity spin was similar when Edison's sprawling beachfront power plant 
in El Segundo changed hands the following year. ""Consumers in California will 
begin to benefit from more competitively priced electricity and more vibrant 
economy,"" announced Craig Mataczynski, vice president of Minneapolis-based 
NRG Corp., a partner in the purchase with Dynegy.

Big Growth Was Predicted
Utilities reaping profits from plant sales also trumpeted the consumer 
windfall theme. Electricity rates would drop 20% by 2001, Pacific Gas & 
Electric's top executive, Robert Glynn, said in early 1998. ""There is no 
product bought on a daily basis that has such a predictable downward price 
trajectory into the future.""
But to its Wall Street audience, the power suppliers emphasized climbing 
revenues.
Atlanta-based Southern Co., now Mirant, told investors in 1999 that its plan 
to buy plants and market power had brought the company to the ""doorstep of 
significant growth opportunities.""
""We believe our strategies will result in the best shareholder return 
available,"" Bill Dahlberg, then-chief executive officer, said shortly after 
buying three California plants.
Mirant spokeswoman Jamie Stephenson said assurances given the public and 
assumptions directed to Wall Street were ""just a different way of delivering 
the same message."" The firm was saying it would be ""reliable to shareholders 
and reliable to consumers.""
Now, with rolling blackouts and record electricity bill increases, federal 
and state authorities are alleging that large energy suppliers played the 
power market too hard.
Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it found evidence 
of $124 million in ""unjust and unreasonable"" charges during the severest 
periods of electricity shortage. The commission, often criticized for being 
too lenient on private power companies, ordered the firms to refund the money 
or further justify the charges.
Some firms are contesting the findings, saying the prices they charged were 
justified. 
Investigators and regulators have faced a vexing challenge trying to unravel 
the complex financial workings of the large power traders. The companies 
closely guard information, and some recently refused to comply with subpoenas 
from the state Public Utilities Commission, which is also probing the power 
market.
Whether the Senate investigating committee will have the resources and 
tenacity to get much further remains to be seen. But Democrats and 
Republicans alike insist they are serious about untangling how the power 
market went haywire.
""I haven't seen that much smoke where there hasn't been a fire,"" Dunn said.

There is some talk of a working group being convened beginning next week comprised of Legislative staff and industry to continue to try to work out a deal.
For now, however, the free world is safe from the CA Assembly and the Senate--they've left and all Legislative activity is on hold until the 20th of August, unless leadership, or the Governor tries to bring them back early.

Based on latest info hear's latest assessment of Gov's talk:

I'm in charge.
Here's all the wonderful things I've done thus far to address the crisis 
(likely to include Edison TX talks, since it seems he has no choice but to 
continue that charade).
It's bad and getting worse and we've got to pull together as a state to get 
through it.
Rate increases are a necessary evil that---painful as they are, and they will 
be painful---must be part of the solution; and future increases may well be 
likely.
Blame FERC and the generators, because it's their fault.
Windfall profits is a good idea.

Your note flagged something for me.  I assume the Nancy McFadden mentioned in 
the article hails from the Clinton administration.  I ""sorta"" worked with 
Nancy when she was at the Department of Transportation.  She would remember 
me, at least.  If you ever need to explore this contact, let me know.  
Otherwise I am glad to let sleeping dogs rest.

The Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed 
late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of 
interest involving their official duties and personal finances. 
A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, 
according to state records.
All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator 
whose stock they owned. 
In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from 
her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential 
conflicts was handled. 
Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the 
conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file 
required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which 
included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants ""may have 
crossed the line,"" said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. 
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their 
personal financial interests. 
Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could 
undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most 
influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements 
that led to the firings. 
Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in 
promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state 
bond sale in U.S. history. 
The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman 
have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the 
$12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The 
companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through 
with the purchase of utility transmission lines. 
Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a 
separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political 
reform laws. Critics question the distinction. 
""The governor's approach may be convenient for him,"" said Jim Knox, executive 
director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, ""but it ignores the 
law."" 
Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that ""decisions are 
not being made by people who have a conflict of interest,"" Knox said. ""Trying 
to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to 
be doing."" 
The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding 
the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration 
as it rushed into the power trading business this year. 
More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according 
to state records. 
In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government 
ethics laws. 
It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even 
basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The 
state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly 
within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. 
Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the 
circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key 
information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to 
state when they bought the energy stocks. 
One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of 
interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a 
Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the 
governor of ""a conscious policy of secrecy"" in enforcing compliance with 
public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and 
Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 
4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine 
The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San 
Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 
billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. 
While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said 
they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More 
than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine 
in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records 
available. 
""We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these 
stocks,"" the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an 
interview. 
The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a 
$500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power 
and negotiating contracts, records show. 
A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed 
owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had 
participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could 
not be reached for comment. 
The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, 
Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be 
reached Friday by The Times. 
All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a 
now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early 
days of California's electricity deregulation. 
Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts 
calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, 
including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern 
California. 
Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him 
that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the 
stock a week ago. 
He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and 
saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value 
each time. 
Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team 
Thursday and fired. 
""I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't 
give me an answer,"" Mead said. ""[He] just said your services are terminated. 
""I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the 
lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger 
pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and 
we're the pawns."" 
Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other 
traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work 
for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power 
Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after 
disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office 
said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. 
Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, 
in her final days working at the electricity exchange. 
A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal 
to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. 
On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state 
and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. 
One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. 
The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power 
for up to 20 years. 
In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others 
reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And 
two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility 
that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. 
Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power 
plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after 
deregulation. 
Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, 
said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly 
before he began work for the state Feb. 28. 
Purchase of Enron Stock Defended 
""I don't see a conflict,"" he said. ""At the time, we weren't really dealing 
with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron."" 
Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict 
until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or 
lose his job. 
That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. 
""We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the 
highest ethical standards,"" he wrote. ""That standard is not met by those who 
hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on 
behalf of the state on energy related matters."" 
""Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must 
divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she 
refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person."" 
However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with 
his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. 
Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la 
Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not 
have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not 
consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of 
projects. 
Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including 
the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters 
and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the 
record. 
Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, 
prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval 
of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. 
Pact Specifies Financial Advice 
The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to 
provide ""financial advisory services"" to the state. 
The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings 
stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and 
Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like 
the other two firms, it too was hired to provide ""financial advisory 
services"" to the state. 
That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the 
administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power 
company interests. 
The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a 
longer contract.

LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  ""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind,"" he said. ""The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators.""

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a ""blind pig could
make money"" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell


  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  ""It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it,"" Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP ""an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers.""

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

Harry, Marty Sunde, Jeff Dasovich and I were on a trip with Ken Lay last 
week.  I understood from Marty that Ken may believe that all customers, 
including direct access, should pay the increase you mention.  Marty?  This 
was encouraging from a litigation exposure standpoint because, to the extent 
all consumers are treated alike, our DA customers who were resourced to 
utility service cannot claim to have been disadvantaged by our action.  The 
converse is also true:  if they have to pay because they were put back on 
utility service they may try to pass that cost through to us.  To the extent 
that any increase is to pay back DWR for buying power 2/1/01-3/31/02, and 
those on DA are not required to pay this, EES could have a substantial 
exposure to its customers.   Maybe we need to modify our strategy to take 
this into account.

Davis announces first round of long-term power contracts 
DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
Monday, March 5, 2001 
,2001 Associated Press 
(03-05) 12:31 PST SACRAMENTO (AP) -- The state has reached 40 long-sought 
long-term contracts and other agreements to keep power flowing to customers 
of two financially ailing utilities, Gov. Gray Davis announced Monday. 
The deals will supply an average of nearly 8,900 megawatts per year for 
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers over 
the next 10 years and let the state buy power for far less than it has been 
paying on the costly spot market, Davis said in a written statement. 
One megawatt is enough power for about 1,000 households. 
For the first five years, the contracts provide power at an average price of 
$79 per megawatt hour, about 75 percent below recent costs on the spot 
electricity market, Davis said. 
The price drops to an average of $61 per megawatt hour, about 80 percent 
below spot prices, he said. 
``These agreements are the bedrock of a long-term energy solution,'' Davis 
said in remarks prepared for delivery Monday afternoon in Los Angeles. ``The 
provide reliability at a reasonable price.'' 
Some of the contract negotiations will result in accelerated power plant 
construction, adding an estimated 5,000 megawatts to the state grid within 
the next two years, some by this summer, Davis said. 
The contracts amount to 75 percent of the long-term deals the Davis 
administration has sought under a new law that lets the state spend an 
estimated $10 billion over a decade to buy power for Edison and PG&E 
customers. 
Davis has pitched such contracts as one way to lift California out of its 
energy crisis. Negotiations have taken longer than expected, however, as his 
administration and power providers haggled over how much the state should 
pay. 
The Davis administration wants to stop paying for power on the expensive spot 
market, where desperation to keep the lights on leads to inflated prices. 
On Friday, the state released another $500 million to continue making such 
purchases on behalf of the state's two big cash-strapped utilities, bringing 
its spending so far to some $3.2 billion since early January. 
The agreements announced Monday include more than 20 power suppliers, 
including electricity giants Duke Energy, Calpine, Dynegy, Enron and Reliant. 
Davis declined to release details on individual contracts. 
Duke Energy said it has reached a $4 billion, nine-year agreement to sell 
electricity to the state. 
The memorandum of understanding calls for Duke to provide 550 megawatts 
starting next Jan. 1. That's enough power for roughly 550,000 households. 
That amount would rise to 800 megawatts Jan. 1, 2003, enough electricity for 
the equivalent of 800,000 households. The contract would continue through 
2010. 
``We believe long-term contracts provide the critical underpinning for a 
stable electricity market and are happy the state is moving in that 
direction,'' Bill Hall, head of Duke's California operations, said in a 
written statement. 
The state is buying about one-third of the power used by the customers of 
Edison and PG&E. Both have been denied credit by suppliers who fear the 
financially troubled utilities won't pay for the power. 
California plans to recover those costs by issuing $10 billion in revenue 
bonds in May, with the rest of that money going to finance the cheaper, 
long-term power contracts. 
In addition to the long-term contracts, the Department of Water Resources has 
reached 11 agreements letting it buy a substantial amount of power on the 
day-ahead market, cutting the state's payment of premium prices on the 
real-time market, Davis said. 
A Stage 1 power alert was called Monday morning with reserves threatening to 
drop to 7 percent due to power plant maintenance and low electricity imports, 
said Patrick Dorinson, spokesman for the Independent System Operator. The ISO 
manages the state's power grid. ",enron_mail/maildir/kean-s/discussion_threads/2645,8,8,57,1,0,1,23,21,0,0,730,35,72,137,90,4.719178082191781,80,904,4349,233,345,90

Two additional, minor points:
Nice job of pointing to FERC leadership on 636 under Bush senior.  If memory 
serves, I believe that Bush Sr. also signed the 1992 Energy Policy Act.  
EPAct is arguably one of the most important pieces of energy legislation in a 
generation---might want to allude to it, and signal the need to take the next 
important steps (which are described well in subsequent bullet points) to 
finish the job--which is far from finished.
We (rightly) say price caps are ill-advised, but don't follow with the 
alternative (though the points, when taken together, comprise it).  Might 
want to add a bullet after ""price caps are bad"" that says something like, 
""The most effective way to lower prices is site and build more generation and 
more transmission and end the ability that tx owners currently have to 
unfairly block the flow of electrons in interstate commerce.""

Talking points look great.

Davis devises new borrowing plan 
His executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism. 
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis. 
The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged Davis last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan. 
With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis. 
""That is one scenario,"" Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal. ""There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced."" 
Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors. 
Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. 
The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. 
The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that authority. It rejected the Davis plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its president, Davis appointee Loretta Lynch. 
Davis earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market. 
The plan now under review, however, would bypass that. 
The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the Davis plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers' utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect, guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street. 
The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. 
Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations, but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. 
""I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great,"" Lynch said. ""But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of those two things."" 
The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco. 
Davis opposes Burton's bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers. The power companies' contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which Davis believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute. 
If Davis signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next year. Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion shortfall in other income.

 FYI.  Edison has been successful at peeling off one of the ESPs--New West.  Seems that in exchange for getting paid negative CTCs, New West may have agreed to take the position that all DA customers should be charged for Edison's undercollection. I'm not aware of any other ESPs that are willing to take that position.  The salient quote in New West's ""supplemental"" PHC statement reads:

""It is the position of New West Energy that all customers, both bundled service customers and direct access customers, are equally responsible for payment of the net undercollections.  Fairness dictates that bundled customers and direct access customers are both assessed their fair share of the responsibility for repaying the amount of the net undercollections as may be determined by the Commission.""

Obviously, not a helpful statement.  New West's supplemental PHC statement is attached.

Davis announces four new energy advisors


Updated: May 18, 2001 - 2:54 p.m. 
Gov. Gray Davis has added four new advisers to his energy staff, including 
members of former Vice President Al Gore's staff and campaign team. 

Chris Lehane, former Gore press secretary, and Mark Fabiani, a deputy 
campaign manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential run, will coordinate the 
governor's communications staff on energy issues and help recruit a new 
director of communications. 

Lehane and Fabiani's company will earn $30,000 per month for six months. 

Nancy McFadden, former deputy chief of staff to Gore, will earn $118,000 a 
year as a senior adviser to the governor, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' 
spokesman. McFadden will concentrate on the governor's relations with federal 
regulators and with generators. 

Davis also has recruited Kellan Fluckiger, chief operations officer for the 
Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid. 

Fluckiger is ""on loan"" from the ISO, and will work with energy suppliers, 
Maviglio said.

The games continue in California.  

The date of suspension now being considered in 83xx is July 12.  We are still 
working (1) to define this in a way that is favorable to getting our recent 
DASR group authorized for DA service or (2) supporting some other solution.

Will keep everyone informed as information comes in.  

By the way, I've asked Evan Hughes for a detailed listing of how moving the 
date impacts our success ratio.

Greetings. Forgive the delays.  The meeting can largely be summarized by the 
CEC presentation.  I'll have Joseph email it to you.  In a nut shell, there's 
more interstate pipeline coming to the California border than there is 
INTRAstate capacity to take it from the California border to the 
consumer/business.  The CEC's forecasts show that things will be tight in 
California.  The thrust of the workshop is that, just like power plants, 
intrastate pipeline capapcity is lagging demand in California and California 
needs to make a concerted effort at revitalizing the in-state gas 
infrastructure and do it quickly.   Hope this is helpful, and again, sorry 
for the delay.

Best,
Jeff

DELETE IF NOT A BART SHUTTLE RIDER.

A BART shuttle rider recently suggested that the shuttle leave 5 minutes
earlier (9:35 pm rather than 9:40 pm) to accommodate the BART schedule.
Apparently, the extra five minutes gets students to the station just
shortly after BART leaves, causing students to wait until the next train
20 minutes later.

If you a BART shuttle rider, please provide me some feedback.

Let me open by saying welcome, and by apologizing for the fact that 
California has probably made your first days on the job a bit crazy.  

Just wanted to pass along some info.  I'm sure you've seen Senator 
Feinstein's comments to FERC.  And I think you're aware that she held a 
meeting in California with a group of stakeholders (including Davis staff) on 
the day before FERC's recent workshop at which Steve testified.  She stated 
at the meeting that she is thinking seriously about sponsoring legislation to 
place a price cap on the entire WSCC market.  Economists in the room 
expressed their strong misgivings about caps, but Feinstein seemed fairly 
focused on at least sponsoring some sort of legislation.  Not sure where it 
will go, but wanted to pass it along.

The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very 
difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's 
going to be left dangling.

In the Senate:
The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of 
the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.
Burton announced during one of the two ""informational"" hearings that ""this is 
it,"" despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the 
committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.
The key features of the bill are:
Banks and QFs get paid in full.
Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers
No direct access.
There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill 
tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the 
Republicans will go along with it.

In the Assembly:
The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with 
Hertzberg's the likely winner.
That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the 
amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).
We're attempting to get the ""July 12"" date changed to ""the effective date of 
the bill"" or later.
The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the 
earliest.

The Problem:
The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each 
approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the 
night.
The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and 
Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.

The likely outcome given the circumstances:  
Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a ""fair"" bill); 
the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; 
they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.

That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit 
down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin 
talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given 
Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.

In short, little has changed since yesterday.

Thanks Robert:
One caution.  It's important that the first-cut analysis be ""simple"" and 
uses, to the maximum extent possible, the MOU numbers and modeling.  This 
allows us to explain a complex situation to people who aren't necessarily 
""numbers oriented"" and to do so with an ""apples-to-apples""  comparison.  
That's not to say that we won't be doing scenarios--we will--but it's 
important to have, at the outset, the cleanest, simplest version of ""here's 
what core/noncore looks like when we apply your numbers to your model.""  That 
said, I understand that even with the simple base case, some tweeks are 
likely.   Talk to you in an hour.  Thanks again for the help.

Best,
Jeff

The CPUC decision on rate design should be used to develop the core rate 
comparison.  That decision has not been issued yet, but it may happen today.  
It would take the form as the schedules that have been previously used, but I 
think we can use a more summarized version of it.

With regard to calculation of the transmission component, I agree that the 
T&D rate for core, if allocated on a system average basis is understated.  
Reviewing some data filed by PG&E in the rate design hearing, I suggest that 
the T&D component be factored up by 1.25.  This is based on the average T&D 
component for PG&E's ""core"" customers to the average system T&D rate 
component.  Similar information was not available for SCE and San Diego, but 
suggest it could be used as a proxy.

The Hearings
The hearings have transitioned to the more traditional, courtroom-like 
environment, with lawyers engaged in detailed cross-examination of utility 
witnesses.
The hearing focused solely on the utility claims of financial hardship.
The hearings went from 9AM-5PM and only managed to make it through two PG&E 
witnesses--extensive, detailed questions on PG&E's cash management practices 
since restructuring started in 1998.
Questions to witnesses focused in particular on PG&E's use of cash for 
investment and financing activities over the past 2-3 years (e.g., 
dividend/stock repurchase activities, transfer of cash from IOU to parent and 
parent's use of that cash for investment activities).  
Questions also focused on options other than rate increases available to the 
utility (e.g., liquidate certain assets of unregulated biz units, loans from 
parent, bankruptcy).
The commissioners and the ALJ have reacted in extremely hostile manner toward 
PG&E's repeated attempts to amend and add to their proposal as the hearings 
progress.
Questioning of PG&E witnesses will continue at 10 AM on Tuesday, followed by 
Edison witness.
Unclear when the hearings will end, though the Commission is scheduled to 
issue its decision on Thursday.
At this point, it seems very unlikely that the Commission will have developed 
the record necessary to do anything other than raise rates under its general 
ratemaking authority.

Outside the Hearing
Intense negotiations between Governor's office and utility management 
continue.
Seems that the Commission/Administration is beating up on the utilities 
inside the hearing room in an attempt to soften the utilities up and gain 
some leverage in the negotiations taking place outside the hearing room.
Governor continues to try to bring consumer groups into the negotiations with 
utilities, but consumer groups continue to resist and continue to oppose any 
rate increases.
Governor seems to be attempting to set up a situation where the Commission 
absorbs the political heat for raising rates on the 4th, and the Governor 
follows-up with a more comprehensive set of proposals as part of his state of 
the state speech on the 8th.",enron_mail/maildir/kean-s/all_documents/6445,5,6,41,7,1,2,1,1,80,80,350,17,39,54,27,5.085714285714285,30,409,2189,137,194,12

State discloses spot power  buys

By Andrew  LaMar
TIMES STAFF WRITER  


SACRAMENTO -- They range from small power  sales of $922,000 by the East Bay 
Municipal Utility District to more than $1  billion of power sold by 
Atlanta-based Mirant power company.  

All told, California paid $7.7  billion in spot purchases of electricity from 
69 agencies across the United  States during the first five months of 2001, 
according to a report delivered to  lawmakers Monday.  

The data also shows that the state paid a hefty average of $263 per  
megawatt-hour for the power. But what's most striking is the long list of  
agencies, both private and public, that sold power to California.  

Agencies like the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, $331 million;  the 
California Independent System Operator, $3.9 million; Public Service Company  
of New Mexico, $126 million; and PG&E Energy Trading Company, $24 million.  

Receiving the most money was Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold $1.2 billion 
of  electricity to the state January through May. The second-largest seller 
was  Powerex, a subsidiary of Canada's BC Hydro, which earned $1 billion.  

The total cost per day ranged from as little as $20 million to more than 
$100  million on three separate days in May, when hot weather and tight 
supplies  boosted spot market prices.  

In addition, the report reveals that the state's energy consultants  
significantly underestimated the amount of energy the state would need to buy 
in  April and May. Navigant Consulting, Inc., forecast the state would have 
to buy  12.1 million megawatt-hours for the two months but the state ended up 
purchasing  15.1 million megawatt-hours.

Hmmm, sounds like the pressure's getting to Mike a bit.  A vacation might 
help.  I think you're entitled to continue on, if that's your decision.  You 
may not have the attendance you prefer, but I don't oppose moving the Gas 
Accord talks forward.

Once again I implore you to put at stop to this madness and hold any 
further ""Gas Accord II"" settlement
discussions in abeyance until the current electricity crisis has 
abated.  There is neither the time nor the mental capacity to deal with all 
of these issues at the same time.  For God's sake, STOP 
IT!!!                                                              Mike Florio

With the 15-day negotiation session nearly moribund, generators and power=

But Wagner, who mediated the talks, also suggested that power sellers are=

Wagner also outlined a method that he said FERC should use for calculating=

Power sellers acknowledged that the threat of litigation remains worrisome =

from legal action as part of their bargaining position.=20
During two weeks of negotiations ordered by FERC, the two sides came nowher=

John H. Stout, a senior vice president at Reliant Energy Wholesale Group,=

Figures scrutinized
""This is the first time we've heard any of this information. And to give th=

impression that somehow there's been cooperation or forthcomingness, I thin=
k=20
is misleading,"" Kahn said.=20
The state's refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talk=
s.=20
The $8.9 billion figure emerged from a study by the California power grid=

operator of charges for electricity between May 2000 and May 2001, a period=

when wholesale power prices soared.=20
Kahn said the figure was essentially duplicated when the state went back an=

FERC last month had been in effect for the entire yearlong period.=20
FERC ordered the pricing method in a bid to tame wholesale prices in the=20

In a partial win for the state, Wagner said he would recommend that FERC us=
e=20
the order retroactively as a basis for calculating refunds, an approach=20
resisted by the power sellers.=20
But he said that FERC should only scrutinize charges going back to October=
=20
2000, and should make several key changes in how power-generating costs are=
=20
calculated.=20
For instance, he said, FERC should determine the actual amount of gas heat =

takes to generate a megawatt of electricity and use spot market prices in=
=20
Northern and Southern California to determine the cost of gas, rather than =
a=20
statewide average cost, computed monthly.=20
Fewer overcharges?
Those and other parts of the complex formula Wagner will recommend could=20
increase the benchmark cost of producing power and drive down the amount of=
=20

Kahn said that applying FERC's pricing method only back to October would pu=
t=20
about $3 billion of the state's refund claim off-limits.=20
Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel for Duke Energy North=20

second-highest daily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million.=
=20
The day before, the state spent $100 million.=20
But since May, spot market prices have dropped, due in part to moderate=20

FERC Judge Says State Owed No More Than $1 Billion
From Associated Press

July 9 2001

WASHINGTON -- California is owed no more than ""a billion dollars"" from powe=
r=20
wholesalers, a federal regulatory judge said today at the end of 15 days of=
=20
settlement talks in the state's electricity crisis.

Curtis Wagner, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's chief=20
administrative law judge, said that at the same time the power suppliers=20
probably are owed more than that.

The net effect of his preliminary recommendation is that California probabl=
y=20
will receive no refunds from wholesalers.

Wagner said power generators had offered $761 million in refunds. The state=
=20
has asked for $8.9 billion since May 2000. Wagner said he will not recommen=
d=20
refunds for power sales that occurred before Oct. 2.

It was not immediately clear what impact the judge's preliminary=20
recommendation would have on efforts to settle the dispute.

Both sides said before the judge's announcement that they expected a=20
protracted legal battle in the event the talks did not produce a settlement=
.

Michael Kahn, Gov. Gray Davis's representative in the talks, has said the=
=20
state would seek more than twice the claimed overcharges if the dispute mov=
ed=20
from mediated talks to a courtroom.

The producers reiterated today that California's numbers are grossly=20
inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators-- Duke Energy, Dynegy,=20
Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos.-- said in a statement that the=
y=20
have made a ""very substantial global settlement offer.""

John H. Stout, a senior vice president for Reliant Energy, said his company=
=20
would agree to no more than $50 million in refunds, as part of an overall=
=20
settlement that also would have to include protection from additional legal=
=20
claims.

But Stout also said, ""Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains=
=20
that no refunds are justified.""

FERC ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences betwe=
en=20
producers and the state over the breakdown of California's deregulated=20
electricity market.

The state has accused the producers of manipulating supply to unfairly driv=
e=20
up prices. The producers have acknowledged that prices are high, but blame=
=20
jumps in the price of natural gas, which fuels many power plants, and the=
=20
workings of the free market.

The bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last year=
=20
from $7 billion the year before. Davis has estimated that the state could=
=20
spend as much as $50 billion this year.

Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame
Power: Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried,=

July 10 2001

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse grou=
p=20
of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who h=
as=20
aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show.

During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of=
=20
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private=20
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid t=
o=20
Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the=
=20
Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.

Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per=
=20
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas=
 &=20
Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Powe=

the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour=20
charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292=
=20
an hour by the DWP. In fact, some of the biggest private power companies=20
singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc.,=
=20
Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid=
=20
for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 pe=
r=20
megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents.

The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased=
=20
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more=
=20
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencie=
s.

Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest=
=20
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have=20
reaped the highest profits over the longest period.

""You have to look at the whole picture,"" Maviglio said.

""The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the=20
generators who wear cowboy hats,"" he said. ""Their profits were 100% to 400%=
=20
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are chargi=
ng=20
us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting=20
ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte.""

The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times o=
n=20
the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's=20
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first=20
quarter.

The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in th=
e=20
first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's=
=20
energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited=
=20
to a few generators.

Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the=20
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year=
.=20
""All the prices were high,"" he said, noting the downward trend in costs sin=
ce=20
his agency began buying power in mid-January.

The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 =
in=20
January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour t=
o=20
$271, the reports show.

In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded=
=20
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, o=
ne=20
of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per=20
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, =
a=20
total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.

By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a=20
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average=20
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.

A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the ""vilification of=
=20
Enron was based on politics, not facts."" Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not b=
e=20
reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past,=
=20
the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered=20
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.

A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric,=
=20
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to se=
e=20
the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reach=
ed=20
Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing=

the power needed by the state were extremely high.

More Power Bought Than Projected

Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts,=
=20
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas=
=20
prices, have begun to tame the state's market.

Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May,=20
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected.

Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply proble=

in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of stat=

projections in June and early July.

The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June=

Duke Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data
Power: Senator says the generator is refusing to make public some informati=
on=20
crucial to the price-gouging probe. Firm says it's complying.
CARL INGRAM
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 10 2001

SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing suspected price=20
gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday that Duke Energy=
=20
is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigatio=
n.

Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the price bidding informatio=
n=20
from its Chula Vista plant available to committee members and staffers. But=
=20
under a federal confidentiality rule, the data cannot be made public withou=
t=20
Duke's consent.

The documents concern the Chula Vista plant, which former employees have=20
alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days i=
n=20
January. However, state records show that the agency overseeing the=20
electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing througho=
ut=20
the state. Dunn said Duke's refusal thwarts the committee's investigation a=
nd=20
efforts to enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential=20
information cannot be shared with others in the Legislature or the public.

Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission tha=
t=20
gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and=
=20
which stay secret.

""The only one who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by wh=
at=20
is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less,"" he said.

Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers

Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the informati=
on=20
elsewhere and ""release it over Duke's objections.""

Three former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last mont=
h=20
under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in wh=
at=20
seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency.

But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the=20
California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity=
=20
grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its=20
explanation.

Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full=
=20
picture of the plant's operation during the three days.

But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging,=
=20
said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed dat=
a,=20
Duke was guilty of the same tactics.

""Duke is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full=20
picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions=
=20
until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred,"" Dunn said.

To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive=
=20
up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine ""the bids Duke=20
submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant."" They include the=
=20
expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said.

Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several plants in=20
California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and=20
off-limits to legislators not on the committee.

Duke spokesman Tom Williams insisted that the generator is attempting to=20
comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke=
=20
would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records t=
he=20
committee plans to turn over.

""We are complying now,"" Williams said. ""There is some suggestion that we ar=
e=20
leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't=
=20
know what we are ultimately going to do.""

The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they=
=20
provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, ha=
ve=20
said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant,=
=20
were cited.

Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are=20
trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formal=
ly=20
charged with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is th=
e=20
final arbiter of such issues.

Although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited=
=20
for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing severe fines. In 1929, the most=

NEWS ANALYSIS
Concern Over Price of Long-Term Power Pacts Grows
Embedded costs may yield more rate hikes, critics say, and the $43-billion=

TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 9 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Even as the summer progresses without blackouts, and Gov. Gra=
y=20
Davis prepares for yet another news conference today to symbolically switch=
=20
on a new power plant, the work in the Capitol has shifted to the seemingly=
=20
more daunting task of balancing the books.

It's a task with potentially far more long-lasting implications for state=
=20
coffers, for businesses' bottom lines and for consumers' wallets.

In particular, long-term power contracts trumpeted by the governor's office=
=20
as helping to bring stability to California's out-of-control electricity=20
market are having the opposite effect politically. A growing concern about=
=20
the $43-billion price tag of the contracts is complicating one of Davis' mo=
st=20
ambitious energy initiatives: a proposed financial rescue of Southern=20
California Edison, which already faces an uncertain fate in the Legislature=
.=20
Questions about the contracts come as California readies a complex=20
$13.4-billion bond sale to reimburse the state's general fund for other pow=
er=20
purchases.

Critics worry that costs embedded in the contracts, on top of the billions=
=20
needed to pay for the Edison rescue, could lead to additional electricity=
=20
rate hikes for consumers. Key lawmakers, consumer advocates and business=20
lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pacts be renegotiated.

Citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs, these critics say the sta=
te=20
should work to shorten the duration of the contracts and lower some of the=
=20
prices. They argue that the state entered into the deals under duress after=
=20
California's utilities neared insolvency and the state Department of Water=
=20
Resources took over the purchasing of electricity for more than 25 million=
=20
residents.

""They are vulnerable,"" Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen=20
(D-Marina del Rey) said of deals the state struck with independent power=20
companies when prices were at record highs.

Bowen lauds Davis administration negotiators for signing ""the best deals th=
ey=20
could."" But she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiation=
s=20
took place, ""the state had two cards and the generators had 50.""

Contracts Open to Challenges

The contracts could be challenged in court or, more immediately, before the=
=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington. There, an administrativ=
e=20
law judge could direct that the pacts be reworked as part of a settlement o=
f=20
allegations by Davis that generators overcharged the state for electricity =
by=20
$8.9 billion.

""We ought not to say, 'Fine, the contracts were the best we could do,' ""=20
Bowen said.

For his part, Davis says he is willing to accept partial payment of the $8.=
9=20
billion in the form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state. He=
=20
attributes the recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to=20
conservation, the administration's effort to increase power supply and--a=
=20
major factor--the long-term contracts, which slashed the state's reliance o=
n=20
the volatile daily, or spot, market.

""You can see the value of these long-term contracts . . . dramatically=20
shrinking our overall price, which is what matters to Californians,"" Davis=
=20
said, pointing out that the average cost of power plunged 30% from May to=
=20
June.

Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, who helped negotiate the contracts,=
=20
said they may end up costing less than $43 billion, given the recent declin=
e=20
in prices for natural gas, the main fuel for California's=20
electricity-generating plants.

Freeman also compared critics to someone who calls the fire department to=
=20
douse a blaze. ""After the fire is out,"" he said, ""you complain about the=20
water damage.""

The contracts have other defenders, among them UC Berkeley economics=20
professor Severin Borenstein, who says the deals helped to tame the volatil=
e=20
spot market by reducing generators' incentive to drive up prices, while=20
reducing the state's exposure to wild swings in price.

""The point of signing long-term contracts is not to get a great price; it's=
=20
to reduce risk,"" Borenstein said.

Still, experts have been picking through the pacts ever since a Superior=20
Court judge in San Diego, ruling in a California Public Records Act lawsuit=
=20
by news organizations and Republican lawmakers, ordered last month that Dav=
is=20
unseal the contracts.

An analysis done for the Assembly by three experts--one each representing=
=20
Southern California Edison; the Utility Reform Network, a consumer group; a=
nd=20
large electricity consumers--concluded that the about $43-billion price tag=
=20
announced by the administration may not account for all the costs. When oth=
er=20
expenses are factored in--ranging from environmental equipment upgrades to=
=20
any new energy-related taxes--the contracts could cost an additional 10% to=
=20
20%.

""Once the contracts were made public,"" Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte =
of=20
Rancho Cucamonga said, ""just about anyone who can read began calling for=20
those contracts to be renegotiated.""

As buyers' remorse spreads through the Capitol, the contracts increasingly=
=20
are seen as a hurdle--or a bargaining chip--as Davis and lawmakers confront=
=20
fast-approaching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis fro=
m=20
morphing into a broader financial crisis.

A bill pushed by Davis to avert bankruptcy for the financially hobbled=20
Southern California Edison must be approved by Aug. 15. The deadline could =
be=20
tighter, because the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn for a monthlong=20
break July 20.

Davis' rescue plan, along with legislative alternatives, languishes in the=
=20
Legislature. The plan, which has little apparent support, would require the=
=20
state to buy Edison's system of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and=20
permit the utility to charge ratepayers for the rest of its back debt of $3=
.5=20
billion.

Some lobbyists and lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approve=
d=20
in March by the California Public Utilities Commission--at 3 cents a=20
kilowatt-hour the largest in state history--may not be enough. The revenue=
=20
generated under the new rate structure must cover the costs of the long-ter=
m=20
power contracts and repay the planned $13.4 billion in bonds, which would b=
e=20
the largest municipal deal ever.

Whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for the Edison rescue=
=20
remains to be seen. But some experts say the utility may need to seek a=20
separate rate hike to cover its costs.

As written, the contracts have few escape clauses; Davis cannot simply walk=
=20
away from them if he concludes that prices are too high. Still, criticism=
=20
persists and crosses political lines.

Harry Snyder, longtime Sacramento lobbyist for Consumers Union, and Jack=20
Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn.,=20
rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate. But in separate=20
interviews, they sounded similar themes.

""If there is a way to buy our way out of these contracts, even if we have t=
o=20
pay damages, we'd be better off in the long run,"" Snyder said.

Stewart, like other business leaders, does not advocate abrogating the=20
contracts. But like many familiar with the terms, he hopes that some deals=
=20
can be renegotiated.

""They are problematic,"" he said.

In a move that critics fear could lock in high electricity prices for the=
=20
next decade, the Davis administration is pushing the PUC to agree within a=
=20
month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by the Department o=
f=20
Water Resources as it goes about procuring power.

State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the PUC must act so he can complete the=
=20
$13.4-billion bond sale. A binding agreement is necessary so that Wall Stre=
et=20
investors can be assured that they will be repaid.

""The state will be out of cash by the end of the year without the bond sale=
,""=20
he said. ""We will move toward fiscal insolvency.""

The so-called rate agreement, a draft of which was obtained by The Times,=
=20
would bind customers of the three big regulated utilities to pay more than=
=20
just the principal and interest on the $13.4 billion in bonds. Consumers=20
would have to pay for consultants, lawyers, to pay taxes, fees and other=20
as-yet-undefined charges that may be incurred by the Department of Water=20
Resources.

Additionally, the PUC would be obligated to approve payments for programs b=
y=20
which the state would pay large and small customers to cut electricity use,=
=20
although the Legislature has not approved the programs and their details=20
remain to be worked out. The Department of Water Resources estimates the co=
st=20
to be $800 million, spread over this year and next.

""It is loaded up,"" Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco)=
=20
said of the proposed rate deal, adding that it would require the commission=
=20
to ""raise rates to cover whatever the Department of Water Resources decides=
=20
to do.""

""That is giving a blank check to some bureaucratic office,"" he said.

'Dictatorial Power' Warning

Stewart of the manufacturers group also is alarmed by the plan, saying it=
=20
would provide the water agency with ""dictatorial power.""

""As skeptical as we are of the PUC process, at least there is a process,""=
=20
Stewart said, referring to the commission's procedures to set electricity=
=20
rates. ""There is no process for DWR. DWR just tells the PUC, 'This is what =
we=20
need,' and the PUC must approve it.""

Others say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work, given the=20
extraordinary step the Legislature took in January when it authorized the=
=20
Department of Water Resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so=
=20
deeply into debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to=20
consumers.

In essence, Davis energy advisor Freeman said, lawmakers in January created=
=20
""the equivalent of a public power purchasing agency"" beyond the jurisdictio=
n=20
of the PUC.

""There is no public power agency in California that is reviewed by the PUC,=
""=20
said Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.

Washington -- An administrative law judge, delivering a powerful message to=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis and California energy officials, cast aside the state's cla=
im=20
that it is owed $8.9 billion in electricity overcharges by generators and=
=20
called for further hearings to determine ""hard numbers.""=20
The judge, ending talks designed to settle the dispute between California a=
nd=20
power sellers, said the state and its cash-strapped utilities may owe more =
in=20
unpaid electricity bills than they are owed for overcharges by the=20
generators.=20
The comments by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chief administrative l=
aw=20
Judge Curtis L. Wagner, although a strong endorsement of the generators'=20
position, seemed to indicate that neither side wanted to settle the issue=
=20
before it reached the five-member regulatory commission.=20
""There are refunds due (to California) that total hundreds of millions of=
=20
dollars and maybe a billion dollars,"" Wagner said yesterday.=20
""At the same time, there are sums due to sellers from the California=20
Independent System Operator and the investor-owned utilities in the state o=
f=20
California that probably are higher than any overcharges that (the state) m=
ay=20
come up with.""=20
Now, it will be up to the federal regulators to settle the case. But the=20
recommendations by Wagner, who mediated the talks, carry significant weight=
=20
with the commission and cast doubt on the state's chances of collecting the=
=20
full $8.9 billion it claims to be owed.=20
The judge said he will recommend that the commission order new hearings to=
=20
calculate what the state and the power sellers are each owed. The hearings=
=20
would be overseen by an administrative law judge and would last 45 to 60=20
days, Wagner said.=20
CLOSING SESSION
Wagner made his comments in the closing session of the 15-day talks, which=
=20
were ordered last month by the regulatory commission to try to defuse the=
=20
dispute between power wholesalers and California officials before it reache=
d=20
the courts.=20
The judge's message was a sharp rebuke to the unyielding stand by Californi=
a=20
leaders -- especially Davis, who last week said he wouldn't take a dime les=
s=20
than $8.9 billion for California's consumers.=20
The governor issued a statement shortly after the close of talks insisting=
=20
that California had won its basic case that the state is owed refunds.=20
""I am pleased that Judge Wagner accepted our methodology for calculating=20
refunds and rejected the generators' position that no refunds are due,"" Dav=
is=20
said.=20
The governor's chief representative at the talks, Michael Kahn, called the=
=20
judge's statement a ""ringing endorsement"" of the state's call for refunds.=
=20
Kahn said the judge's order would improve the state's legal position if it=
=20
files suit against power sellers.=20
GENERATORS FAVORED
But much of the judge's order seemed to favor the generators.=20
For example, state officials have made the case they should be refunded $8.=
 9=20
billion for alleged overcharges from May 2000 to May 2001 -- even though th=
e=20
regulatory commission has said only that the period starting Oct. 2, 2000=
=20
could be considered.=20
The judge said yesterday that he would stick with the October date, meaning=
=20
that more than a third of the state's claim -- at least $3 billion -- would=
=20
not be refunded by the commission.=20
Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy North=20
America, said that under Wagner's guidelines, the state may be eligible for=
=20
$1 billion to $1.5 billion.=20
""Certainly to the extent that it helped refute what California has been=20
saying, it's a victory,"" Bailey said of the judge's statement.=20
But Davis said the nation's big power sellers never came to the table with =
a=20
serious offer.=20
""Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayers out of billion=
s=20
of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good faith,"" Davis said.=
=20
$716 MILLION OFFER=20
Wagner disclosed yesterday that the generators had made an offer to=20
California: $716 million in refunds.=20
The judge said the figure included about $510 million from the so-called Bi=
g=20
Five generators, as well as $125 million from BC Hydro's Powerex, $49.6=20
million by a group of 15 electricity marketers, $16.5 million by six=20
California municipal utilities and $25 million offered by other out-of-stat=
e=20
power sellers.=20
California officials say it was not a legitimate offer because it included =
no=20
cash. It was simply an agreement by the companies to wipe some of the state=
's=20
debt off the books.=20
Throughout the talks, generators complained that the California team was=20
trying to shield some California companies and government power providers=
=20
from having to pay any refunds, and trying to disproportionately extract su=
ms=20
from out-of-state power companies.=20
FAVORITISM CHARGED
According to documents and interviews, the state attempted to remove Pacifi=
c=20
Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric.=
,=20
the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and other government power=20
suppliers from the group from which it was asking for refunds, even though=
=20
they were paid the same high rates for power as everyone else.=20
Representatives for the power sellers said they believe that Davis made a=
=20
political decision to demagogue the companies while refusing to compromise =
on=20
the state's claims. They say the governor calculated that his reputation=20
would be enhanced by continuing to attack the generators.=20
""The California delegation did not come into these talks with any willingne=

paying off.=20
""This is the third plant I've helped open in the last 13 days,"" Davis said,=

pumping his fist as the Calpine Corp. plant belched an impressive burst of=

Davis used yesterday's event to blast out-of-state generators that he=20

Calpine as a sort of energy favorite son.=20
""They were the first to enter long-term contracts with us,"" the governor=20
said. Calpine is among the big energy firms being pressed by the state to=

issue refunds for what the governor insists were overcharges, but unlike th=
e=20
others, Davis said, Calpine is giving ground in negotiations.=20
""They likely will be the first to enter into settlements with us,"" he said.=
=20
Although the Los Medanos plant is one of a generation of efficient new gas-=
=20
fired plants that will be as much as 40 percent cheaper to run than their=
=20
forebears, the state will be paying well above current market rates for the=
=20

Calpine President Peter Cartwright insisted, however, that the company is n=
ot=20
making excess profits off the deal. To ensure that Calpine could provide th=
e=20
electricity even if plant construction wasn't finished by its mid-July targ=
et=20
date, the company bought the needed power from other energy traders at $232=
 a=20

In addition to the 300 megawatts it has pledged to the state, Calpine will=

supply electricity to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and other=

In the long term, Calpine will be selling power to California at $59 a=20

A spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which started buyi=

Power suppliers, state fail to agree on refund total=20
Posted at 10:41 p.m. PDT Monday, July 9, 2001=20
BY JIM PUZZANGHERA=20

Mercury News Washington Bureau=20


WASHINGTON -- California officials and power suppliers failed to agree on=
=20
refunds for electricity overcharges as 15 days of contentious negotiations=
=20
ended Monday, leaving the matter in the hands of a federal judge who said t=
he=20
state is owed much less than the $8.9 billion it demands.=20
The judge overseeing the talks for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
put the refunds at between several hundred million dollars and a billion=20
dollars. His estimate is closer to the $716.1 million offer made by power=
=20
suppliers during negotiations. The offer was rejected by California=20
officials.=20
But it was unclear Monday which side in the bitter refund battle would=20
prevail, and California officials indicated the dispute is probably headed =
to=20
court. At stake is how much the state's electricity consumers will ultimate=
ly=20
have to pay for costs that skyrocketed as California's deregulation system=
=20
collapsed.=20
Curtis Wagner, the commission's chief administrative law judge, will=20
recommend a formula for the commission to use to calculate a refund dating=
=20
back to October. That formula -- a complex methodology that involves factor=
s=20
such as daily natural gas prices -- includes many of the provisions the=20
energy suppliers had advocated during the talks.=20
Michael Kahn, who headed the California negotiating team, said the state=20
would contest some aspects of the formula. But even without changes, Kahn=
=20
said he was confident the formula will result in more refunds than Wagner=
=20
estimated.=20
``We think the numbers even using the judge's formula are going to be in th=
e=20
multiple billions,'' said Kahn, chairman of the state Independent System=20
Operator, which runs the electricity grid. ``California will get its $8.9=
=20
billion dollars. If we don't get all of it from the commission .?.?. we'll=
=20
still get the remainder of the money'' through the courts.=20
Amount in dispute=20
Power industry representatives appeared pleased with the judge's plan.=20
``We haven't gone and run the full numbers but it's going to be nowhere nea=
r=20
the $8.9 billion,''' said Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel=
=20
for Duke Energy North America. ``But let's face it, that's a pie-in-the-sky=
=20
number that nobody in there believed in their right mind was a legitimate=
=20
number.''=20
Wagner acknowledged he had not calculated any figures using his formula,=20
saying he arrived at his dollar estimate based on the offers made by the=20
suppliers.=20
The energy commission ordered the private settlement conference last month=
=20
when it enacted new price controls to try to rein in soaring electricity=20
prices in California and throughout the West. Commissioners hoped that unde=
r=20
pressure of a deadline and their looming intervention the state and the pow=
er=20
suppliers could resolve the refund issue and stave off future litigation.=
=20
But the suppliers and state officials never came close to a deal,=20
participants said.=20
``The numbers were too far apart. You saw $8.9 billion on one end and you s=
aw=20
$716 million on the other end, and that's a long way to splitting the=20
difference,'' Wagner said. ``I think a lot of the parties genuinely wanted =
to=20
settle. Others didn't.''=20
Wagner now has until Monday to make his recommendation to the five-member=
=20
commission, which will make the final ruling on refunds. To date, the=20
commission has ordered $125 million in refunds for periods since last Oct. =
2.=20
Wagner said Monday that he will ask that a special hearing be set up in the=
=20
next 60 days to get the detailed information from the state and power=20
suppliers needed to determine a refund total using his formula.=20
The state may not end up with any cash, as any refund total could be applie=
d=20
to the several billion dollars California and its utilities still owe many =
of=20
the power suppliers.=20
Reflecting the tone of the negotiations, California Gov. Gray Davis on Mond=
ay=20
blamed power suppliers for the failure of the talks and challenged the=20
commission to resolve the situation.=20
``Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayers out of billio=
ns=20
of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good faith with our team=
=20
in Washington, D.C.,'' Davis said. ``While in the past the FERC has shown=
=20
little, if any, interest in consumers, they now have the opportunity to=20
redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 billion California has demonstrated=
=20
it is owed.''=20
Davis may go to court=20
At the opening of a new power plant in Contra Costa County on Monday, Davis=
=20
told reporters that he's prepared to take the power generators to court if=
=20
FERC doesn't order the full refund. Davis also said the ISO's estimate of=
=20
$8.9 billion doesn't represent all the overcharges. He said other estimates=
=20
put the figure as high as $20 billion, although he did not elaborate about=
=20
how those figures were calculated.=20
John H. Stout, senior vice president for Reliant Energy Wholesale Group, sa=
id=20
the state used faulty methodology to arrive at the $8.9 billion figure.=20
California officials and several suppliers said they would continue to=20
negotiate separately, and an official with San Jose-based Calpine said his=
=20
company is close to a settlement with the state.=20
Power suppliers urged Wagner not to calculate refunds by applying the energ=
y=20
commissions' June price-limits plan retroactively. But that's what Wagner=
=20
said he will do. It was a victory for California officials, who had pushed=
=20
for it. Wagner, however, also made some changes to the price-limit plan tha=
t=20
power suppliers had wanted. He applied it only back to Oct. 2, 2000. State=
=20
officials wanted it to cover up to May 2000.=20
$3 billion difference=20
The state's $8.9 billion figure comes from May 2000 through May 2001.=20
Factoring refunds beginning with Oct. 2, 2000, eliminates about $3 billion =
in=20
overcharges the state says occurred in the earlier period.=20
Among the changes to the commission's formula that Wagner made was to revis=
e=20
the way the prevailing electricity price limit is calculated. Wagner wants=
=20
the price limit determined for each hour of each day. The commission's=20
formula sets a price limit during Stage One power emergencies that remains =
in=20
effect until the next emergency.=20
But in a sign of just how complex the issue is, Stanford University economi=
st=20
Frank Wolak said he believes the standards described by the judge will=20
produce a much higher figure than $1 billion.=20
``That's the methodology the state used,'' said Wolak, who advises the=20
California ISO on market issues. ``By using the marginal unit for each hour=
,=20
you'll get refund numbers on the order of what the state estimated.''=20

SACRAMENTO -- Six months after jumping into the electricity business, the=

California's daily power purchases, showing more than $5 billion in payment=
s,=20
much of it to government-owned utilities and private companies that state=
=20
officials have branded as price gougers.=20
The state spent an additional $2.5 billion on a variety of contracts and=20
other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy market=
s,=20
according to documents that the state agreed to release last week amid a=20
legal dispute over public access to the data.=20
In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2=20

electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hyd=
ro=20
in British Columbia. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angeles Departmen=
t=20
of Water and Power.=20
The documents raise questions about some of the common assumptions that hav=

arisen around the electricity crisis. For instance, almost 40 percent of th=

state's purchases have come from government-run power generators in=20
California and elsewhere, but not Texas; some of the biggest suppliers are=

from the Northwest.=20
Gov. Gray Davis, who has ambitions to run for the White House, has put much=

of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies based in=20
President Bush's home state.=20
The figures are tucked inside 1,770 of pages of invoices that Davis has=20
resisted divulging, saying disclosure would encourage suppliers to charge=
=20
more. The state, which last month released information on its long-term=20
electricity contracts worth $43 billion, agreed Thursday to release the fir=

quarter details.=20
Short on explanation=20
The figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Wate=

Resources, which buys power for the state's financially strapped major=20
utilities, and seem to buttress the administration's contention that the=20
price of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for=
=20
what prompted the decrease.=20
In January, for instance, the average price for power on the spot market wa=
s=20
$321 a megawatt hour. It peaked in April at $332 and dropped to $271 in May=
.=20
One megawatt powers about 750 homes.=20
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governor's=
=20
assertions that California has been gouged. ``The bad guys are clearly the=
=20
out-of-state generators,'' Maviglio said. ``There has been a significant=20
shift of money out of California.''=20
But the documents fail to shed much light on whether, as the administration=
=20
contends, the price drop was due to long-term power contracts negotiated by=
=20
the state earlier this year. Critics contend that the Davis administration=
=20
panicked and rushed into deals that commit the state to pay high prices for=
=20
many years.=20
Used for support=20
Republican officials used the price information to bolster their attacks=20
against Davis, a Democrat, for signing long-term contracts with power=20
generators even as the price of power on the spot market was coming down,=
=20
partly because of the declining price of natural gas used to fuel many=20
plants.=20
``It's more clear than ever that the long-term contracts are a bad deal,''=
=20
said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. ``The governor's really hurt=
=20
the ratepayers for the next five or 10 years.''=20
The newly released bills highlight the volatility of California's energy=20
market, where the price per megawatt hour ranged from $70 to $1,000. On any=
=20
given day, the records show, the prices from seller to seller varied widely=
,=20
with some of the highest prices being charged by public utilities and=20

Refund outlook dims=20
Talks break down; judge says state is owed much less than its $8.9 billion=
=20
demand -- and unpaid bills may offset gains.=20
July 10, 2001=20
By DENA BUNIS
and JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register=20
WASHINGTON The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California is=
=20
owed maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the=
=20
$8.9 billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis.=20
And even at that, said Judge Curtis Wagner, the electricity sellers are owe=
d=20
so much more in unpaid power bills that in the end California might not see=
=20
one red cent.=20
Wagner announced his recommendation to the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission after two weeks of fruitless negotiations between all the partie=
s=20
to California's electricity crisis. With no settlement, the matter is now i=
n=20
the commissioners' hands.=20
Power generators, Wagner said, had offered a combined $716 million in=20
refunds, an offer the state rejected. ""I don't think it's 8.9 (billion=20
dollars),"" he said afterwards, ""because I haven't been shown that it was.""=
=20
For California consumers, every dollar the state can extract in refunds is =
a=20
dollar less that ratepayers have to shell out for state-purchased power. An=
d=20
the more money the state gets back, the better the chances of warding off=
=20
future rate increases.=20
""California will get its $8.9 billion,"" insisted Michael Kahn, head of the=
=20
state's delegation and the California Independent System Operator. Kahn=20
brushed off Wagner's comments, finding victory in the judge's assertion tha=
t=20
the state is owed some refunds, a concept the generators have been unwillin=
g=20
to embrace up to now, he said.=20
Since the talks began, some generators have made refund offers -- last week=
=20
Duke Energy offered $20 million and on Monday, Reliant officials revealed=
=20
their refund offer was $50 million, provided all other actions against the=
=20
company were dropped.=20
But the net result of the 15- day closed-door sessions is that California i=
s=20
no closer to getting repaid for what it claims was price gouging by power=
=20
companies going back to May 2000 than it was the day the talks began.=20
And it means the state is in for possibly more hearings before the FERC. If=
=20
unsuccessful there, the whole issue could wind up in court for years.=20
""You can take a horse to water but cannot make him drink,"" Wagner said duri=
ng=20
an afternoon public session where he made his preliminary recommendation. H=
e=20
has seven days to put his ideas in writing. At several points during the=20
often-tense talks, Wagner expressed frustration to the negotiators and trie=
d=20
to get them to agree, even to the point of holding an unprecedented Sunday=
=20
session.=20
""The numbers were too far apart,"" Wagner said.=20
While Kahn insisted the state had made progress, on hearing of the judge's=
=20
comments, state Sen. John Burton, D-Francisco, called them ""barely better=
=20
than a jab in the eye with a sharp stick."" Burton agreed with Kahn that the=
=20
state has to do all it can to get more than that.=20
And Davis backed up his team.=20
""Our delegation made a clear and compelling factual argument that there wer=
e=20
overcharges made because the market was broken,"" Davis said. ""Remarkably, t=
he=20
energy generators and suppliers refused to recognize their responsibility t=
o=20
the people of California and own up to their profiteering.""=20
Power generators seemed satisfied with the judge's views, even though John=
=20
Stout, vice president of Reliant Energy, said his company's ""fundamental=20
position has been and remains that no refunds are justified.""=20
Brent Bailey, general counsel for Duke Energy, called the judge's=20
recommendation, ""a fair one.""=20
Republican lawmakers in Sacramento were quick to say it was Davis' failed=
=20
energy policies that brought California to this point. They also distanced=
=20
themselves from the state's refund request.=20
""I don't believe there really exists a true justification for that number,""=
=20
said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine. ""I've never considered that=20
anything more than a wild number to throw out there.""=20
The two sides are so far apart in their estimates of overcharges because th=
ey=20
are using different assumptions about how to compute the complex pricing=20
structure. And Wagner was more persuaded with the majority of the generator=
s'=20
methods.=20
To start with, the state is asking for $8.9 billion, but about $3 billion o=
f=20
those alleged overcharges happened between May and October 2000, a period=
=20
FERC is not looking at. FERC issued two refund orders in March, finding tha=
t=20
power companies had $124 million in overcharges during power alerts. But th=
e=20
state is challenging that finding, saying there were overcharges beyond tho=
se=20
limited times. And the state is also asking FERC to reconsider allowing=20
refunds for May to October 2000.=20
How energy panel affects California=20
Six months ago, few people had heard of FERC. Now the Federal Energy=20
Regulatory Commission, the agency charged with making sure that the nation'=
s=20
power markets are running smoothly and that wholesale prices are ""just and=
=20
reasonable,"" rolls off the tongue.=20
The five commissioners who make up FERC - all of whom were members of their=
=20
home state's Public Utilities Commissions - ordered the settlement talks th=
at=20
concluded Monday. They had hoped all the parties involved in California's=
=20
electricity crisis could reach an agreement on proposed refunds, long-term=
=20
power contracts and other issues that have divided the parties for months.=
=20
FERC's chief judge, Curtis Wagner, was asked to mediate the talks.=20
WHAT WAS AT STAKE?=20
For the state: $8.9 billion that Gov. Gray Davis said was the amount power=
=20
companies overcharged California in the past year. Wagner's finding? There=
=20
should be refunds. But more like $1 billion.=20
For the generators: More than $5 billion that they say they are owed for=20
unpaid power bills. Wagner's finding? Generators are owed more money than t=
he=20
refunds they owe California. He did not specify by how much.=20
For California consumers: A stable electricity market. Until the refund iss=
ue=20
is settled and power prices are stabilized long term, what the future holds=
=20
for rate increase remains uncertain. Wagner's finding? No settlement.=20
Consumers still in limbo.=20
HOW DID WE GET HERE?=20
In spring 2000, wholesale power prices began to soar. The state began=20
appealing to FERC to cap wholesale prices. In the meantime the utilities we=
re=20
running out of money. Generators weren't paid for all the electricity they=
=20
sold. Rolling blackouts began.=20
Starting in January, the state began buying the power, replacing the=20
near-bankrupt utilities. Politicians from Sacramento to Washington increase=
d=20
the pressure on FERC to cap rates. More than $27 billion was spent to buy=
=20
power for California last year, compared with $7 billion the year before. T=
he=20
price tag could reach $50 billion this year.=20
On June 19, FERC imposed the kind of soft price caps experts say could=20
moderate wholesale rates. Wholesale prices have come down, but the caps hav=
e=20
caused confusion among generators, leading some to hold some power off the=
=20
market.=20
WHAT'S NEXT?=20
The FERC commissioners will receive Wagner's report within a week. In it, h=
e=20
will suggest they hold a fast-track formal hearing that would last no more=
=20
than 60 days.=20
If they agree, after that hearing the commission would rule on refunds and=
=20
other California market issues.=20
If either the state or the other parties to this dispute disagree, they can=
=20
contest FERC's decision in court. Such legal proceedings could last many=20
years.

But since May, spot-market prices have dropped, due in part to moderate=20

California and Generators Still Split After 2-Week Talks

WASHINGTON, July 9 -- A federal mediator ended two weeks of negotiations=20
about California 's demands for electricity refunds today, with the state a=
nd=20
power suppliers seemingly no closer to a settlement than when the talks=20
began.=20
The failure of the negotiations shifts the burden of resolving the yearlong=
=20
dispute to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to which the mediator=
=20
may recommend a pricing formula that would mean refunds of about $1 billion=
.=20
California , which wants $8.9 billion, vowed today that it would seek that=
=20
much and more, through the courts if necessary.=20
Although electricity prices in the West have eased in recent weeks, the pow=
er=20
crisis that has afflicted California and other Western states seems unlikel=
y=20
to be resolved unless rival parties can agree on how much electricity shoul=
d=20
have cost during the last 13 months.=20
The power market has been mired in an accounting gridlock. The state claims=
=20
that generating companies began grossly overcharging for electricity -- wit=
h=20
prices soaring by a factor of 10 or 20 over year-before levels -- beginning=
=20
in late spring last year. Generators say they are prepared to pay some=20
refunds, but argue that California 's estimates of overcharges are radicall=
y=20
inflated.=20
The mediator in the settlement talks was Curtis L. Wagner Jr., an=20
administrative law judge for the federal agency, who said today that the=20
negotiations had failed to reach the comprehensive voluntary settlement he=
=20
had sought.=20
Mr. Wagner said he would recommend to the agency's commissioners that they=
=20
convene a 60-day evidentiary hearing that would impose an administrative=20
solution. He also said he would suggest a method for determining fair price=
s=20
for electricity .=20
Under federal law, the energy commission has the obligation to ensure ''jus=
t=20
and reasonable'' electricity rates. Though the commission declared last yea=
r=20
that California 's electricity market had broken down, it only recently beg=
an=20
imposing price controls on the market and has yet to address accusations of=
=20
past overcharges systematically.=20
While the scope of any refunds remains uncertain, Mr. Wagner's remarks=20
appeared more favorable for generators than for Western states, which have=
=20
collectively pressed for as much as $15 billion in refunds.=20
Mr. Wagner said that to determine how much California should have paid for=
=20
power since last September, when the commission began monitoring California=
=20
energy prices, he would suggest that the agency retroactively apply a price=
=20
control formula it adopted in June. He also indicated that he supported a w=
ay=20
of calculating the costs of power generation that is closer to the method=
=20
favored by power companies than to the one put forward by California=20
officials. The judge suggested that the formula he is recommending could=20
require generators to pay back hundreds of millions or ''maybe a billion''=
=20
dollars.=20
California officials gave a positive cast to the judge's statements, callin=
g=20
them a step forward because he formally acknowledged that companies would=
=20
have to pay some refunds. They also noted that whatever the level of=20
federally mandated refunds, they would have the option of seeking more in=
=20
court.=20
''We are still going to get the $8.9 billion,'' said Michael Kahn, who=20
represented Gov. Gray Davis of California in the talks. ''If we don't get i=
t=20
all from the commission, we will get the remainder in the courts.''=20
Governor Davis himself said today that if the agency did not provide refund=
s=20
in the amount the state claims it is owed, it would sue generators for $18=
=20
billion to $20 billion. ''We are in a war with generators, mostly out of=20
state, that are trying to bleed us dry,'' Mr. Davis said, speaking at the=
=20
ceremonial opening of a power plant in Northern California .=20
Representatives of several generating companies said that during the=20
settlement talks, they collectively offered to refund California about $500=
=20
million. They estimated that the calculation method suggested by the judge=
=20
would result in refunds of no more than $1.5 billion -- far closer to their=
=20
offer than to California 's demand.=20
Still, several executives said they now hoped to reach individual settlemen=
ts=20
with the state that would end the threat of prolonged litigation and allow=
=20
them to collect several billion dollars they say they are owed by the state=
=20
and its leading, financially pressed utilities, which ran up huge debts to=
=20
suppliers in the last year.=20
''We remain very interested in reaching a global settlement with the state=

that will put this problem behind us once and for all,'' said Brent Bailey,=

""The numbers were too far apart,"" Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the=

Calpine Corp. of San Jose and possibly one other supplier are expected to=
=20
reach individual settlements with the state, the judge said.=20
""A lot of the parties genuinely wanted to settle and others didn't,"" Wagner=
=20
told reporters. ""There's an old southern saying,"" said the 72-year-old=20
Tennessean. ""You can take a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.""=
=20
He declined to say which side balked, but previously he had blasted=20
California officials for not modifying their initial demands.=20
Wagner said he will send his own refund formula to FERC's five commissioner=
s=20
within a week. His formula essentially will reflect what he thinks reasonab=
le=20
electricity prices would have been in the state at various times since=20
October, considering fuel costs and other factors. Charges over those level=
s=20
would be subject to refund, if FERC agrees.=20
The judge's recommendation is likely to carry considerable weight with FERC=
's=20
commissioners, according to energy analysts. Earlier this year, FERC=20
tentatively ordered $125 million in refunds for the first three months of=
=20
this year, an amount that Davis called far too low.=20
Facing increasing political pressure from Congress, FERC -- with two new=20
members appointed by President Bush -- has taken a harder line on Californi=
a=20
's power prices. Last month, the commissioners imposed price restraints on=
=20
wholesale power transactions in California and 10 other western states.=20
Wagner patterned his formula after FERC's ruling last month.=20
The nation's wealthiest state has been battered by an extraordinary surge i=

electricity and gas prices that have pushed its electricity costs up from $=
7=20
billion in 1999 to an estimated $27 billion last year. Power prices did not=

retreat from record levels until last month.=20
Davis's top aides quickly claimed vindication yesterday.=20
""We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are going to be in t=

System Operator, the state's power grid manager.=20
Kahn noted that the state refused to drop a growing list of legal claims=20

legal claims as part of any settlement, according to sources close to the=

negotiations.=20
""We will have a viable claim in state court and other jurisdictions for the=

But the state's own expert witness, economist Eric Hildebrandt, chief marke=

federal deadline for settling $8.9 billion of disputed California electrici=
ty=20
charges, as a federal mediator overseeing the talks suggested the state's=
=20
demand was excessive.=20
Cautioning that he hadn't done formal calculations, Curtis L. Wagner Jr., t=
he=20
chief administrative law judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,=
=20
put the level of potential refunds at ""hundreds of millions of dollars, may=
be=20
a billion dollars."" He also said any sums due the state could well be offse=
t=20
by monies its insolvent utilities owe in unpaid power bills.=20
Mr. Wagner said he would recommend to the commission that any refunds be=20
calculated only from October -- the state had been seeking rebates calculat=
ed=20
from May 2000 -- in line with an earlier FERC jurisdictional ruling. That=
=20
decision alone would shave $3 billion from the $8.9 billion claim.=20
Mr. Wagner, who is expected to issue formal findings in the next few days,=
=20
said he would recommend that the FERC hold an evidentiary hearing to assess=
=20
the correct method for figuring refunds.=20
The collapse of the talks doesn't preclude individual deals later between=
=20
energy companies and the state, which has accused them of overcharging for=
=20
power during the past two years. Yesterday, some industry lawyers indicated=
 a=20
willingness to keep bargaining, and Mr. Wagner said two ""partial"" settlemen=
ts=20
were in the works.=20
Yet, absent any such solution, the overcharge issue -- a flash point in the=
=20
California power crisis -- is apt to be resolved in protracted legal and=20
regulatory proceedings, which could drag on for months or even years.=20
The negotiations began June 25, with a deadline set for midnight last night=
.=20
But late yesterday, participants indicated they were billions of dollars=20
apart, with basic differences over everything from the disputed charges to=
=20
doubts about whether the FERC, which ordered the talks, could enforce a dea=
l=20
because of the industry's questions about the reach of the agency's=20
authority.=20
""We haven't reached a settlement. We really haven't come close,"" said John=

p.=20
Reliant had offered to pay California about $50 million to extricate itself=

g=20
profit during the relevant period, he said, although far shy of the more th=
an=20
$375 million California sought from Reliant.=20
Mr. Wagner said the industry offered a total of $716 million to settle the=
=20
matter.=20
The refund issue is fast becoming a test of the agency's authority and=20
credibility. The FERC, a onetime regulatory backwater, has come under inten=
se=20
scrutiny of late for its largely hands-off monitoring of deregulated=20
California markets. The commission has ordered some companies to pay refund=
s,=20
but they have been relatively small -- such as a $124 million rebate coveri=
ng=20
wholesale electricity bills in California in January and February.=20
California Gov. Gray Davis has said he hopes two new FERC members will take=
 a=20
much more aggressive tack. The agency is expected to act quickly on the=20
judge's call for a hearing and other findings.=20
Yesterday, Michael Kahn, a San Francisco lawyer representing Gov. Davis at=
=20
the settlement, declared he was ""gratified"" by Mr. Wagner's findings, sayin=
g=20
they validated the state's claims to some refunds, a concept the industry h=

rejected at the talks' outset. ""We've had a ringing endorsement of the idea=
=20
of refunds and we'll get back lots of money,"" he said, adding that what the=
=20
state doesn't recoup via the FERC it will pursue in court.=20
But power generators, who derided the state's request for a huge refund as=

California Power-Price Boost Not Needed, Agency Says (Update1)
By Daniel Taub


Sacramento, California, July 13 (Bloomberg) -- California regulators won't 
need to raise electricity prices for consumers to cover a planned $13.4 
billion bond sale, said a spokesman for the agency that buys power on behalf 
of the state's utilities. 

The California Department of Water Resources, which has spent more than $7.7 
billion on power this year, is expected to recommend a rate increase of as 
much as 25 percent, Dow Jones reported today, citing three unnamed members of 
the state's Public Utilities Commission. Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the 
agency, said no rate increase is expected. 

``Our folks are stunned by this revelation because it is nowhere near what 
our numbers show,'' Hidalgo said. ``In fact our numbers show that there is no 
need for any increase beyond what's already been done.'' 

The Department of Water Resources will submit a report to the California 
Public Utilities Commission today or Monday with the state's revenue 
requirements for repaying a planned $13.4 billion bond sale, Hidalgo said. 
The bonds are to be repaid by customers of utilities owned by PG&E Corp., 
Edison International and Sempra Energy. 

The bond sales, the largest municipal offering in U.S. history, are scheduled 
to begin in September. Governor Gray Davis has said repeatedly that he 
believes the bonds can be repaid without further rate increases. His position 
hasn't changed, spokesman Steve Maviglio said today. 

Previous Increases 

In March, the PUC voted to boost rates by 3 cents a kilowatt- hour at the 
state's two largest utilities. Rates at PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric, the 
largest California utility, would rise by as much as 36 percent and Southern 
California Edison rates would rise by as much as 27 percent, the PUC said at 
the time. 

The average consumer-price increase would be 30 percent, the PUC said. The 
increase, the second this year, was intended to help the state pay for power 
purchases. The PUC voted in January to raise rates about 10 percent. 

California Treasurer Philip Angelides has said that the bonds will let the 
state cushion the immediate rate impact on residents and businesses by 
spreading power costs over time. The debt will be repaid over 15 years. 

Investors have said they can't predict how the bonds will be received without 
knowing how much cushion is built into the revenue pledge backing the debt. 

Legislation that paved the way for the bonds allows the state to raise 
electricity rates as needed to cover debt repayment. That pledge, typical for 
revenue bonds, usually entails a promise to raise a specific level of money 
annually to cover interest and principal payments on the debt and provide an 
added cushion. 

That formula, known as a debt service coverage ratio, must result in 
investment-grade ratings for California's power bonds, according to the 
legislation. Investors want assurance that an issuer will raise rates to 
maintain the promised cushion, even if increases aren't needed at the time of 
the bond sale. ",enron_mail/maildir/dasovich-j/notes_inbox/11915,10,8,63,9,1,4,13,1,0,0,517,28,60,103,83,4.750483558994198,57,649,3105,180,256,24

Greetings All:

First, I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email.  Schedule i=
s=20
very tight, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this=
=20
morning, with some back-up info that I've included below.

Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lay's office yesterday evening f=
or=20
delivery to Sen. Brulte.  It's of course confidential.  Few points:

I don't have Bev's email, so if you could please forward to her, that would=
=20
be appreciated.
As we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on=20
Wednesday, I'm assuming that the plan is still to ""wallpaper"" Sacramento wi=
th=20
our proposed legislation.
This email does not contain the legislation.  Mike sent the ""final"" version=
s=20
of our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I=20
believe Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today.
You'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver =
to=20
his office today the proposed legislation.  Again, based on our call on=20
Wednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed=
=20
legislation to the rest of the world at the same time.
When we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would=20
determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same=
=20
time that we deliver the Senator Brulte. I'm assuming that you folks will=
=20
handle that end of things.  Please let us know at your convenience to whom=
=20
you've decided to circulate.
This email does, however, include a ""summary"" of our proposed legislation. =
=20
But I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the=20
appropriate language to distribute ""to the world,"" or if we'll need instead=
=20
to tailor some new language.  I think we all agreed that we need a ""one=20
pager"" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the=
=20
package effectively.
We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our=20
proposals.  We didn't finalize that plan.  Perhaps the Sacramento team coul=
d=20
propose a plan to do that.  Perhaps we could start with our friends in the=
=20
Direct Access coalition?
We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the =
PR=20
machinery activated, also with the goal of effectively communicating our=20
legislative package/message.  We're in a meeting with folks today where we=
=20
can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted=
=20
Marathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term.
You'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWR=
=20
credit issue.  As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call.=
 =20
You note that attached to the email is a ""legislative fix"" to AB1X that cou=
ld=20
solve the credit issue and an attached set of ""taking points"" related to a=
=20
second alternative to solving the credit issue:  a PUC order clarifying tha=
t=20
DWR will get its money for power purchase costs.
Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push to=
=20
get the utilities out of the merchant function.  Accordingly, I've put a=20
brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section=20
(legislative solution) under the topic ""create a real competitive retail=20
market in California.""  To the best of my knowledge, we don't have=20
legislative language on that piece yet, and it seems that we'll need to=20
discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so.


If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email, please=
=20
don't hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss.  I can be best=20
reached to day by pager at 888.916.7184. =20

FYI.  Looks like what we suspected is about to launch, i.e., an orchestrated 
effort by Davis to go after the suppliers.  Just found out the following from 
Sue Mara, who attended the ISO board meeting today:

The ISO is scheduled to release a ""report"" today claiming that suppliers are 
price gouging.
The California AG has subpoena-ed generator-members of the WPTF---very 
extensive questions asking for just about everything under the sun.

Likely that we can expect a loud call for regional price caps very soon.

Best,
Jeff

Davis Wants Generators to Accept Less Than Owed (Update2)

     (Adds names of California generators in fifth paragraph, and
Reliant comment in sixth.)

     New York, Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray
Davis said he intends to ask power generators to accept partial
payment for power sold to the state's cash-strapped utilities this
summer and winter, Wall Street analysts who attended a closed-door
meeting with the governor said.
     ``It looks like the people he wants sharing the pain are the
companies generating power sold to utilities,'' said Kevin Boone,
a bond analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. who attended the meeting
in New York. ``He wants to force them to take cents on the dollar.
That seems to be what his initial proposal will be.''
      PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, and Edison
International's Southern California Edison, the state's largest
utilities, are near bankruptcy after accumulating more than $12
billion in debt buying power from generators at soaring prices.
Regulators have not let the utilities pass on most of their power-
buying debt to consumers.
     Davis said some generators have approached him with offers to
accept less than full payment, said Michael Worms, a utility
analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. Davis spoke to about 35
analysts from Wall Street and energy-research firms in New York in
a meeting that was criticized by investors and analysts who were
not allowed to attend.

                        No Names Mentioned

    Davis didn't specify which companies came to him with partial-
payment proposals, analysts said. Duke Energy Corp., Calpine
Corp., Willams Cos., Dynegy Inc. and Reliant Energy Inc. are among
the biggest suppliers of electricity to California utilities.
    ``I'm not aware of him talking to anyone at Duke about
forgiveness,'' Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said.
      Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said Davis's proposal
``doesn't really come as a surprise'' because politicians in
Sacramento, the capital of California, have been discussing the
idea for weeks. Reliant has opposed anything other than full
payment of its debts.
    ``Williams fully expects to be paid the money that is owed
us,'' spokeswoman Paula Hall-Collins said. ``We have worked in
very good faith with the state, selling voluntarily into the
market, negotiating with them for long-term contracts and working
with them to solve the problem.''
      Enron Corp., an energy trader that has set aside unspecified
reserve for possible losses in California, has not been approached
about debt forgiveness, said Karen Denne, a company spokeswoman.
      ``This proposal. . . is news to us,'' and does not address
the immediate problem of electricity shortages in California this
summer, Denne said. Industry analysts say California, which has
already had scattered blackouts this winter, will face more this
summer when power demand surges.

                     Buying the Grid

     Davis said at the meeting that negotiations to buy PG&E
Corp.'s power transmission system may take another 30 days, though
he was optimistic an agreement could be reached within two weeks,
analysts said. He offered few other specifics on the PG&E talks,
said Steve Fetter, group managing director of global power for
Fitch Inc.
     State officials are trying to reach agreement with PG&E and
Edison, as well as with Sempra Energy, to buy their transmission
lines as part of a plan to help them pay debt and borrow money at
low interest rates to avoid bankruptcy. A tentative agreement to
buy Edison's lines for $2.76 billion was reached last week. Talks
with Sempra are continuing.
     The governor said he was optimistic an agreement with PG&E
could be reached in two weeks, but negotiations could drag on
longer, Fetter said.
       ``We are making progress,'' Davis said at a news conference
after the analysts meeting at the Cornell Club on the east side of
Manhattan. ``We are close to a final agreement with (Edison) and
relatively close with Sempra.''
      The governor told analysts he's confident he can get a
utility rescue plan that doesn't require an immediate rate
increase, but Davis did say that rate increases are going to be
needed at some unspecified time in the future, Fetter said.
    Davis said he wasn't sure if he resolved all of analysts'
doubts about California's plans to save its utilities from
bankruptcy.
    ``He's in a hole and he's got a long way to go to get out of
it,'' said Paul Patterson, an analyst with Credit Suisse First
Boston who attended the meeting. ``We still don't have a final
solution in sight.''
     Shares of San Francisco-based PG&E fell 9 cents to $13.96.
Rosemead, California-based Edison shares fell 4 cents to $14.90.
San Diego-based Sempra fell 16 cents to $22.15.

To add to Bev's comments, I've gotten many calls from large customers today.  
I'll be meeting with them in Sacramento on Monday to discuss the core/noncore

sense.  I've also asked Sandi and the Sacramento team to line up meetings 
with key legislators while I'm there to discuss the same.

Business is, as was expected, very unhappy about that portion of the plan 
that would stick them with all of Edison's debts.  They view it as unfair and 
punitive (which it is) and are frustrated that the Democrats would include it 
simply to ""make the deal Harvey proof.""  Many questioned Keeley about why the 
Democrats are hell bent on pandering to Harvey.  Keely said that the Assembly

Soaring Electric Use More Fiction Than Fact 
Chronicle investigation finds power companies manipulate data to excuse their 
towering rates Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers
Sunday, March 11, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/11/M
N213155.DTL 

Power companies say it so often, and with such certainty, that it has become 
a virtual mantra: ""Skyrocketing"" energy use by Californians is a root cause 
of the state's power crisis, and justification for surging electricity 
prices. 
But a computer analysis of electricity usage data by The Chronicle reveals 
that the mantra is a myth -- that overall growth in electricity demand hasn't 
been nearly as great as the industry portrays it. 
The industry has painted the summer of 2000 as the equivalent of a 100-year 
storm in meteorology -- an event so powerful and unexpected that the existing 
infrastructure was devastated by its force. 
The statistics show that 2000, taken in total, was nothing of the sort. 
Moreover, two independent state agencies' assessments of California's power 
plant capacity appear to show that the growth should have been easily 
accommodated. 
The companies have defended their practice of increasingly taking power- 
generation plants out of service by arguing that heavy demand and consequent 
plant usage necessitated major, time-consuming repairs. 
""The claims that demand growth is rampant and that it was totally unexpected 
and due to the Internet economy, to Silicon Valley, or server farms, 
or people recharging cell phones -- that's bogus,"" said Tom Kelly, assistant 
executive director of the California Energy Commission. ""About as bogus as 
you can get."" 
The Chronicle's findings are based on data collected by the California 
Independent System Operator, a manager of the state's electricity grid. They 
show: 
-- Total electricity consumption in California increased only 4.75 percent in 
2000 from 1999, a sharp contrast to claims of industry representatives, who 
have repeatedly relied on isolated, loose or selective comparisons that make 
growth appear as high as 20 percent. In fact, the single greatest hour of 
electricity usage in 2000 was actually lower than any peak demand period in 
1999 or 1998. 
-- Average peak demand -- the average of the highest hour of electricity 
usage for each day -- increased only 4.79 percent from 1999 to 2000. Even 
during the months of May to September in 2000, when the greatest spikes in 
electricity usage occur, demand growth was only 8.31 percent higher than the 
same period the year before. 
-- More than 30 days of critical power shortage warnings, so-called Stage 3 
emergencies, and two days of blackouts this year occurred at times of 
moderate energy use -- levels often below those at which neither warnings nor 
blackouts have occurred in the past. 
The findings appear to buttress suspicions that the ""skyrocketing demand"" 
explanation for rising energy prices is a cover for what is really happening 
-- 
that power companies have simply started charging more for an essential 
commodity, regardless of whether it is in short supply. 
Presented with The Chronicle's findings, Gary Ackerman, a representative for 
the Western Power Trading Forum, a trade group representing power companies, 
said the calculations support the industry position that electricity demand 
is growing strong. 
""That's pretty healthy growth for California as opposed to the long-term 
historical average, which is close to 2 percent,"" he said. ""To me, that's 
really strong growth."" 
Energy demand is certainly on the rise in California -- growth of more than 4 
percent is still double what was projected -- and the state has obviously 
fallen behind in building power plants. 
Even though a recent study found California ranked 47th out of the 50 states 
in per-capita energy consumption, the surging demand explanation has become 
so accepted that leading officials accept it as gospel. Gov. Gray Davis has 
made energy conservation -- 10 percent, at that -- a centerpiece of his 
efforts to solve the crisis. 
""Energy use is growing,"" said state Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, citing 
the growth of Silicon Valley and high-tech operations statewide. ""There's 
been tremendous growth, whether manufacturing or high tech -- cell phones, 
faxes, whatever. The stuff is growing."" 
Yet the energy industry has been steadfast in its insistence that the 
consumer is largely to blame. In testimony and submissions to government 
bodies considering prescriptions for the crisis, energy demand growth has 
consistently been overstated. 
Joe Bob Perkins, the chief operating officer of Houston-based Reliant Energy 
Inc., told the U.S. Senate in January that California's growing economy and 
high summer temperatures caused electricity use to ""surge dramatically"" -- a 
demand growth of 13 percent. 
Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, said Perkins' testimony was based 
on estimates by the federal Energy Information Administration of monthly 
retail electricity sales. 
""We do stand by that,"" Wheatley said. ""Unfortunately, it does not track with 
ISO data."" 
The industry-backed Edison Electric Institute said in a report that 
electricity demand grew by anywhere from 5 percent to 21 percent during the 
spring of 2000, compared with the same period a year earlier. 
Russell Tucker, an economist for the institute, said the group's figures were 
derived by identifying the single highest hour of electricity demand for each 
spring month of 1999 and 2000 and comparing them, finding the May peak rose 
21 percent. 
Granted, the state Energy Commission uses the same model to determine whether 
California has enough plant capacity to meet demand. But the presentation 
makes it appear that overall demand, not just the absolute peak, is growing 
by 21 percent. When the peak of each day is averaged and compared from year 
to year, May's figure was much lower: 12.79 percent. 
Also, nowhere did Edison's report note that the peak hour of 2000, a load of 
43,784 megawatts on Aug. 16, was actually lower than the peak hours of either 
of the previous two years -- 45,884 on July 12, 1999, or 44,406 on Sept. 
1, 1998. 
The Chronicle analysis of average peak demand showed that no month last year 
grew more than June's 15.34 percent, though no blackouts occurred in that 
month. May and June were the only months when demand growth exceeded 10 
percent, the analysis showed. Most months recorded 4 percent or 5 percent, 
and some -- such as September -- were less than 3 percent. 
Two months, October and December, had demand levels lower than the year 
before -- 4.22 percent less for October, 1.46 percent lower for December. 
Mike Florio, a consumer lawyer and board member of the ISO, said that even 
growth of less than 5 percent from 1999 to 2000 would seem overstated, since 
1999 was a relatively mild weather year and 2000 was a much hotter one. ""You 
are quite right,"" Florio said. "" 'Skyrocketing' demand is a myth."" 
MARKET MANIPULATION?
Consumer representatives and some politicians have long suspected that, 
rather than dire imbalances between supply and demand, market manipulation is 
behind the crisis. 
Generators and power marketers adamantly deny this, saying they have done 
everything they could to keep the lights on. They say they ran aging, 
decrepit plants at higher-than-normal levels last summer to accommodate what 
they described as unprecedented demand. They also say that, at great expense, 
they delayed much-needed maintenance in order to keep the power flowing. 
Their claims have received some support from the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, which said in a report last month that it found no evidence power 
companies were using maintenance schedules to manipulate supply. The report, 
however, was heavily qualified by the FERC, which said it did not investigate 
other forms of manipulation. Moreover, the agency acknowledged that the bulk 
of its investigation was conducted by simply calling power plants and 
questioning them over the telephone. 
The supply side of the energy equation is harder to penetrate, in part 
because supply data are confidential. Thus, the question of how blackouts 
could have occurred at such low levels of demand in January is hard to 
answer. What is clear is that, at times, during the crisis this year, as much 
as 12, 000 megawatts of electricity supply have been unavailable for use, 
mostly because of unplanned plant outages -- about four times the level 
anticipated by the ISO. 
Power companies say the old plants they bought were not capable of producing 
to the levels sketched out by the ISO and the Energy Commission, and that 
everything from low water conditions, emissions limitations and high 
temperatures last year caused less energy to be available than was 
anticipated. 
But others suggest that what began as a shortage caused by a withholding of 
supply to drive up price has turned into one caused by withholdings out of 
fear of not being paid. 
What did go up, unquestionably, were wholesale electricity prices. 
While average electricity usage during the heaviest hours last year increased 
by less than 5 percent, prices charged by power companies to the utilities 
that deliver juice to consumers increased more than 289 percent. 
In June, the cost of a megawatt hour increased more than fivefold, going from 
the 1999 level of $30.53 to $170.60. In October, prices doubled over the same 
period a year earlier, going from $53.47 to $111.04. And in December -- 
despite a 1.46 percent decline in electricity usage from the previous 
December -- peak wholesale electricity prices hit $425.59. They'd been $31.88 
one year before. 
Then the pace of price increases began to accelerate within the last six 
months of 2000. Overall, average peak usage during December was about 31,200 
megawatts, about a fifth lower than it was in August. Average prices in 
December? They just about doubled, to $425 a megawatt hour. 
The companies' explanation for rising prices despite falling demand was that 
more and more plants had to be taken offline for repairs, decreasing supply. 
Even given the high number of inoperable plants, questions remain about why 
the existing supply could not cover demand. 
On the blackout days of Jan. 17 and 18 fewer plants were offline -- and more 
electricity was available -- than on days when the state managed to squeeze 
by without turning out the lights. 
Even today, with Stage 3 alerts having faded away, at least temporarily, 
demand levels remain more or less the same as when California was in a 
constant state of emergency. Moreover, the lists of offline plants are as 
long as ever. 
AMPLE POWER SHOULD EXIST
The Energy Commission and the ISO have concluded that California's power 
plants are capable of generating more than 45,000 megawatts of electricity. 
That means that even with plant repair outages, low water levels decreasing 
hydraulic generation, air-pollution rules and other environmental 
constraints, the power companies should be able to accommodate all but the 
most extreme spikes in demand. 
According to industry data obtained by The Chronicle, the Western Systems 
Coordinating Council, a government-backed trade group in Salt Lake City, 
concluded California would have considerable surpluses throughout 2000, 
including margins as high as 39 percent in December, based on data provided 
to it by the ISO. Even under low water conditions, the ISO reported, the 
state would have total power resources of 47,532 megawatts in that month. Yet 
unplanned outages were far higher, and the system began to crash that month 
and into this year, at far lower levels of demand. 
""Clearly,"" Florio said, ""we should not be having a shortage at 2 a.m. on 
Christmas Eve, when the only person awake is Santa Claus.""

It appears that Davis has officially called the Legislature back to try to address the Edison issue.  Appears they'll reconvene beginning next Tuesday.  We'll report back when we get additional information.  There are some rumors going around that they might meet and simply appoint a ""task force"" comprised of legislators to continue working on the issue.

Davis trying to spin out of energy crisis 
Energy advisers have ruthless reputation 
Ken Garcia

No matter how much you try to spin the facts, the truth usually topples out. 
This will explain why Gray Davis is suffering from a reality blackout, 
because no one spins harder or faster than our opaque leader, who, quite 
equitably, is suffering his own power crisis. 
Why Do You Think They Call Him Gray has an unrelenting black-and-white 
problem. How can he explain away his indecision in grappling with the energy 
crisis sooner, his inability to hammer out a deal with the utilities and 
power suppliers before they had the state handcuffed and his frantic response 
to spend $40 million in public funds to purchase future electricity without 
offering consumers the details of the pact? 
The truth is, he cannot, although he has tried mightily. And to that end he 
made one of his biggest mistakes yet -- no small feat when you consider he is 
at the center of one of the sharpest economic tailspins in California's 
history. 
Rather than tackle the issues head-on, Davis did what he has always done: use 
consultants and polling data to try and navigate the minefield of public 
opinion to put himself in the best possible light and blame others for his 
problems. It's a game Bill Clinton perfected but at which the governor is a 
mere weekend hobbyist. 
Davis' decision to hire two former Clinton-Gore spin doctors to explain away 
his role in the energy crisis has been as predictable as this summer's threat 
of rolling blackouts. If only, in this case, he could have kept his critics 
in the dark. 
While the state's taxpayers were hit with record electricity bills, Davis was 
pointing his finger at every official in the federal government who might 
conceivably have played a role in the crisis and especially those power 
suppliers in the Lone Star state who have been soaking California ratepayers 
dry. 
It is obviously true that the Bush administration has been reluctant to help 
the nation's most populous state because it voted for Al Gore in November. 
And time will probably show that the power companies in Texas and beyond were 
being Snopes-like in their dealings with the Golden State. 
But there is no getting around the fact that Davis severely exacerbated 
California's energy plight through his own inaction -- as evidenced by our 
sweltering soul mates in San Diego who were experiencing blackouts and 
spiraling electricity costs early last summer. 
Yet why suffer the facts when it's so much easier to just scramble them? 
When the energy crisis hit its peak this spring and Davis' popularity ratings 
began short-circuiting, he brought in Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, who had 
been as ubiquitous in the scandal-ridden Clinton administration as the stain 
on a certain intern's dress. 
The pair became so adept at parrying the thrusts of truth directed by the 
press each day that they earned the label ""masters of disaster"" -- which may 
be why Davis thought of them when he considered the calamity beginning to 
envelop him. If only he had considered the accompanying stink. 
Lehane and Fabiani are considered by the political cognoscenti as nothing 
less than ruthless, partisan hired guns, happy to attack anyone standing 
between them and a monthly paycheck. 
Unfortunately for Davis, the rhetorical hit men's salaries are being paid by 
California taxpayers, who are none too happy that they will be socked with 
billions of dollars in extra energy charges as a result of Davis' lack of 
leadership. 
So although Lehane and Fabiani's $30,000 monthly consulting fees may look 
paltry to a governor who has contributed to California's lost billions, it 
looks quite a bit different to those little people in the bleacher seats, 
sometimes known as California's 30 million-plus residents. 
The hiring of the disaster duo has led to a lawsuit by an anti-tax group from 
Sacramento that alleges Lehane and Fabiani are violating the state Political 
Reform Act because the gunslingers have also worked for Southern California 
Edison as consultants -- a generally accepted no-no for public officials, 
even those who worked in Washington. 
And State Controller Kathleen Connell, a fellow Democrat, has rightfully 
refused to pay state funds for the Clinton-Gore castoffs, because she said it 
is inconceivable that the two men are working on state policy -- not politics 
- - as required by law. 
Until obfuscation and misdirection become part of the official state code of 
ethics, it's fair to say Connell is on pretty firm ground. Or as one member 
of a tax protest group put it: ""We are adding insult to injury to have the 
governor who feels the pressure of this crisis to spend this kind of dough 
for damage control."" 
Damage control is not supposed to incite more damage, but right now Davis is 
a metal helmet in an electrical storm. His arrogant treatment of state 
voters, his refusal to shoulder responsibility and his efforts to spin his 
way out of trouble has left even die-hard Democrats searching for a more 
palatable replacement. 
That decision will come next year when Davis is up for re-election. And the 
millions of people who chose him because he seemed a safe but dull choice 
will now realize that there is little solace in gray areas. 
Since the governor is involved, it seems apt to call it a cautionary tale. 
But by the time the spin doctors are through, it may start to sound more like 
an urban legend.

A veteran federal bankruptcy judge in San Francisco now is calling the shots 
in California's long, drawn-out power crisis. 
Judge Dennis Montali has spent eight years helping financially ailing dot- 
coms, consumers and corporations get back on their financial feet. Now he is 
about to take on the biggest case of his career, and lawyers say that he is 
relishing the challenge. 
""He's one of the best judges in the country,"" said Lawrence Goldberg, a San 
Francisco bankruptcy lawyer with Goldberg, Stinnett, Meyers & Davis. ""He 
loves his job and he loves this kind of combat when lawyers come to court."" 
Montali, 60, has built a reputation as a hard-working, enthusiastic judge who 
often knows the facts of a case better than the lawyers. He is a scholar of 
bankruptcy law, having lectured and written law review articles. The more 
complicated the case, lawyers say, the more energized he becomes. 
On a personal level, he can strike the fine balance between the demands of 
the commercial world and the plight of the consumer trying to overcome a 
mountain of credit card debts, lawyers say. 
""He's an excellent draw for the case,"" said bankruptcy lawyer Shawn 
Christianson, with Buchalter, Nemer, Fields & Younger. She said that Montali 
has a combination of pragmatism, intellect and experience that will help him 
understand the problems of all those involved in this statewide crisis. 
Tall and lanky with a handle-bar mustache, Montali is a native of the Bay 
Area. Born in San Francisco, his father worked as a liquor distributor and 
later founded Montali Winery -- later Audubon Cellars -- in Berkeley. The 
young Montali earned his undergraduate degree from Notre Dame University and 
then entered the Navy to fulfill a Reserve Officers Training Corps 
commitment. 
After his discharge in 1965, he entered the University of California's Boalt 
School of Law in Berkeley and earned his law degree in 1968. 
He joined the law firm of 
Rothschild and Phelan in San Francisco and quickly developed a specialty in 
bankruptcy law. By the time he joined the legal giant Pillsbury, Madison & 
Sutro in 1980 he was an established expert. 
While he represented debtors early on in his career, he became a creditor's 
attorney at Pillsbury and quickly built a national reputation for his 
knowledge and his active role in the bankruptcy law community. 
In 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco chose him for an opening 
on the federal bankruptcy court in Northern California. 
One of two bankruptcy judges in San Francisco, he has become an expert in 
doing emergency surgery on companies in critical condition, able to deal with 
crises quickly and with few complications. 
He has gained national prominence as a member of the National Conference of 
Bankruptcy Judges and the American College of Bankruptcy. He also was 
rewarded with an appointment to the bankruptcy appellate panel. 
When he's not bailing out a company, he spends his off hours cooking Italian 
food at his Berkeley home with his wife, Mary. He also loves to sail, walk 
his dog and spend time with his granddaughter. 
""He's going to put his heart into this one,"" said Larry Engel, a veteran 
bankruptcy lawyer with San Francisco's Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison. ""He's got 
the respect of everyone in terms of his fairness and diligence."" 
""California,"" he added, ""is in really good hands in having the case with 
him.""

When to Hold 'Em, Fold 'Em: It might be a long time before PG&E shares 
rebound

U172804.DTL 

If you own PG&E stock, you really need to ask yourself whether you're 
prepared to endure the agony of the next few years. 
When companies go bankrupt, common stockholders are the last to be paid, 
after trade, secured and unsecured creditors. 
Because there are usually not enough assets to pay off all those creditors in 
full, in many cases the creditors give up part of their claims in exchange 
for stock in the reorganized company that emerges from bankruptcy. This 
vastly dilutes the ownership stake of existing shareholders. 
In many cases, the original shareholders end up with a small fraction of 
stock in the reorganized company. And that's after a protracted court 
proceeding that could take two to five years. During that period, there's 
little reason for the stock to rise. 
Although it was Pacific Gas & Electric -- PG&E Corp.'s utility subsidiary -- 
that filed for bankruptcy yesterday, stock in the parent company fell $4.18 
per share to $7.20, and most Wall Street investors see little hope for a 
quick rebound. 
""This is going to be a long, drawn-out process,"" says Claude Cody, manager of 
AIM Global Utilities Fund, which owns stock in PG&E. ""There is going to be 
negative news and positive news, and generally the negative news comes out 
first."" 
Cody explains that when a company is in bankruptcy, the flow of information 
slows down. Many institutional investors won't own stock in a bankrupt 
company, 
and analysts stop following it. 
All the usual methods of valuing a stock, such as price-earnings ratios, 
become meaningless. 
Companies in bankruptcy hardly ever pay dividends. 
PG&E has already suspended its dividend and won't pay one as long as the 
utility is in bankruptcy. 
That's hard on people such as Lee Fischer of San Bruno, who bought PG&E stock 
20 years ago. Fischer, 72, says PG&E accounted for about 15 percent of the 
stock dividends he depends on for retirement income. 
""Everybody said, 'Buy utilities, buy oil, they're always going to be there, ' 
"" he says. 
""I'm pretty upset with our governor. I'm mad at PG&E. They're making 
decisions we have no control over. I'm already losing the money I'm putting 
into my monthly (utility) bills. It's not fair. My emotions are running 
rampant at this point."" 
There are some reasons Fischer and other PG&E shareholders could fare better 
than most stockholders involved in a typical bankruptcy. 
For one thing, shareholders own stock in the parent company, which has some 
unregulated energy assets that could provide cash flow and some support for 
the stock price, provided that creditors of the utility can't seize the 
assets of the unregulated subsidiary. 
PG&E has taken steps to prevent that, but those steps are sure to be 
challenged in court -- a process that could add to the length and complexity 
of the utility's bankruptcy proceeding. 
""In most bankruptcy cases, you don't have this two-sided isolation. 
Shareholders are not getting money from a solvent side while there's an 
insolvent side,"" says Lynn LoPucki, a law professor with the University of 
California at Los Angeles. 
Given its size, stature, the essential nature of its product and its 
importance to the state's economy, some experts say PG&E's bankruptcy could 
be resolved relatively quickly -- maybe in two years instead of three. 
For the very same reasons, others say it will bog down. 
PG&E stock is down 77 percent from its high last September. But that doesn't 
mean it can't go lower. 
Walter Torous, a finance professor at the Anderson School of Management at 
UCLA, has studied what happens to stocks after bankruptcies and found that on 
average, they don't do well. 
""You'd think that if a company announces bankruptcy it takes a one-time hit. 
But it continues to underperform badly over the long term. The market doesn't 
seem to quickly incorporate this bad news,"" says Torous. 
Torous tracked 78 large companies that filed for bankruptcy between 1979 and 
1983. 
He found that during the first year after they filed, their stocks trailed 
the overall market by 38 percentage points. Over two years, they 
underperformed by 57 percentage points. Over three years, they trailed by 
almost 100 percentage points. (He explains that if the market went up 50 
percent and the bankrupt stocks went down by 50 percent, they would trail by 
100 percentage points). 
Torous says that because the companies he studied all went bankrupt around 
the same time, they might not be representative of companies going bankrupt 
during other periods. 
Marty Whitman, manager of the Third Avenue Value Fund, points out that in 
past utility bankruptcies -- such as Public Service Co. of New Hampshire and 
Northeast Utilities -- shareholders who held on came out well, after a number 
of years. 
""In other utility bankruptcies, they've all been reorganized on the backs of 
the ratepayers and taxpayers,"" he says. 
Whitman, who doesn't own PG&E stock but does own secured bonds in the 
utility, was irate yesterday that PG&E didn't ""prepackage"" its bankruptcy. 
That would have involved getting all the parties involved to agree to a 
reorganization plan before filing for bankruptcy. 
""If they did it preplanned, they could be in and out (of bankruptcy) in six 
months,"" Whitman says. 
Instead, he says it could take two to three years. 
Mark Luftig, co-manager of the Strong American Utilities Fund, does not own 
the stock and considers it a highly speculative investment. ""If you can put 
it away for three years, there's an above-average chance you'll get an above- 
average return,"" says Luftig. ""Will you miss a lot of sleep in the meantime? 
Probably."" 
MOODY'S GROWS NERVOUS: Debt-rating agency Moody's said yesterday that it 
changed its outlook on the state of California's general obligation bonds to 
negative from stable, ""reflecting our view that the deepening electric power 
crisis -- compounded by (yesterday's) bankruptcy filing by Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. -- has increased the risks to the state's otherwise strong 
fiscal and economic condition."" 
Moody's is the second bond-rating agency to warn that it might downgrade the 
state's credit rating because of the power crisis. 
In January, Standard & Poor's put the state's credit rating, currently AA, on 
""CreditWatch"" with negative implications.

Hertzberg called.  We very briefly discussed the scenarios that he asked us 
to build for him.  I've attached the file.  the supporting spreadsheets are 
not included.  If folks would like them, let me know.  Please keep the file 
confidential.  

Hertzberg wanted to see what happened to rates for large (noncore) customers 
if the small (core) customers' share of past utility debt is shifted to 
noncore customers.  
Our analsis shows that noncore rates approach Loretta's recent rate increases 
when approximately 50% of core's share of utility past debt is shifted to 
businesess (i.e., to noncore).  (In fact, Edison's rate in this scenario is 
below the Lynch rate, while PG&E's is modestly above.)
Increasing the cost shift above the 50% level would start to push rates 
significantly above the Lynch rates.  
Note, however, that in its recent submission to the PUC, DWR's asserts that 
it's revenue requirement is substantially higher than the revenues support by 
the Lynch rate increase, suggesting that Lynch will have to increase rates 
again soon. 
In addition, Loretta's rates also do not reflect past utility costs, which 
will require yet additional increases.
I expect to have another conversation with the Speaker later this evening or 
tomorrow to discuss the scenarios in more detail  (he would still like to put 
100% of the IOUs past debts on noncore in exchange for getting a competitive 
market and out from under Loretta).
I will report back after we've spoken.
All ideas, suggestions, etc. regarding the attached spreadsheet are welcome 
and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

Summary of the activities since Friday:

Overall, it's 50-50 or better that the Legislature will finish up the budget 
and recess until August 20th, without having passed some form of an ""Edison 
MOU."" Will have a better view of the chances of getting an MOU agreed to and 
passed through both houses by COB Monday.  

In the Senate:
The ""Edison MOU"":
As previously reported, on Friday, SB 78---the Senate's version of the Edison 
MOU--passed out of the full Senate and was sent to the full Senate.
The bill sticks 100% of suppliers' debts with Edison's shareholders but pays 
QFs and other creditors.
The authors believe that suppliers can't force Edison into bankruptcy because 
the claims are with the PX, not Edison, which in their view means that the 
suppliers can't reach Edison.  Our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic 
is strong from a legal perspective. 
The bill creates an option to buy the transmission system, but rejects the 
Goernor's MOU, which buys it outright.
Though there's some uncertainty, the bill appears to end Direct Access.
Information we have indicates that the Assembly does not support and will not 
pass SB 78 in its current form.
Enron (and the marjority of market participants) opposes 78.

The ""Dunn Investigation"":
Dunn released his report regarding contempt charges against Enron on Saturday.
The report recommends that the Senate fine us, beginning with $1,000 the 
first day, and doubling everyday thereafter until Enron ""complies.""
Dunn announced on Saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the 
full Senate for a vote on Saturday.
In response, our lobbyist in Sacramento spoke to a leader of the Republican 
party in the Senate (Ross Johnson), and persuaded Johson to negotiate the 
date of the vote with Burton and Dunn.
She was successful---Johnson went to Burton and got him and Dunn to agree not 
to vote on the report until the Senate returned from its recess on August 
20th.
If the Senate returns early, it could vote prior to the 20th, but the 
likelihood of that happening appears low at this time.

The budget:
The Senate passed the budget at about 1 AM Sunday morning.
The Senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return 
until August 20th.
That leaves the Assembly alone in Sacramento to do its part regarding the 
budget and the Edison MOU.

The Assembly
In short, leadership within the Assembly is extremely weak and without much 
influence over its own party--the Democrats.  
The Speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue.
Unable to do a deal, the Assembly recessed Saturday night and has not 
reconvened. 
It has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget.
The Assembly also has not passed its version of an Edison MOU, which it says 
it intends to do.
Best information we have right now is that the Assembly does not plan to go 
back into session until Tuesday morning.
Late Saturday night, the Assembly Speaker released yet another version of his 
Edison MOU (AB 82XX), but it does not appear at this time that he has enough 
votes among Assembly Democrats to pass it.
Enron--together with business customers--opposes the version of 82XX released 
on Saturday night because it does not adequately ensure Direct Access.

I spoke yesterday with President Lynch's gas advisor and the PUC staffer who 
first got in touch with us regarding inquiries from our customer regarding 
whether we were returning customers to the LDCs.  
I described our activities generally, and explained that the originial 
inquiry from our customer stemmed from a mix-up (on our part) that has since 
been cleared up.  
Both seemed satisfied, appreciated the call and the information and will get 
back to me regarding whether we'll need to submit a formal response to 
President Lynch's letter. (I said that our preference was not to respond 
formally, but would be happy to do so.)
I asked them to contact me directly should they receive any other inquiries 
from our customers.
Thanks to all for the help in responding.
Please keep me in the loop on our marketing activities, etc. 
If I hear anything about customers calling the PUC, I'll let you know, and 
I'll let you know what I hear back from Lynch's office regarding whether we 
need to respond formally.

PUC SET TO MAKE KEY RULING ON UTILITY BILLS;

ELECTRICITY: REGULATORS ARE ABOUT TO DECIDE HOW TO SPLIT PAYMENTS BETWEEN THE
STATE AND UTILITIES. THE FORMULA COULD AFFECT FURTHER RATE HIKES.

BYLINE: RONE TEMPEST, TIMES SACRAMENTO BUREAU CHIEF



DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:


??How much of utility customers' monthly bills will be used to pay for
California's multibillion-dollar entry into the power market?

??That's the question as regulators set out in coming days to determine how to
split ratepayers' bills between the state, which has been buying electricity 
at
the rate of $ 45 million a day since late January, and the debt-laden 
utilities,
which continue to deliver that power and collect customers' payments.

??The issue has moved center stage as Gov. Gray Davis continues to negotiate a
rescue of the near-bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern 
California 
Edison. The resolution is crucial to Davis' complex plan to pull California 
out
of its costly energy crisis.

??When the Legislature put the state in the power-buying business, it needed 
to
ensure eventual reimbursement for its purchases. The result was the CPA, for
California Procurement Adjustment, essentially the portion of customers' bills
left over after the utilities subtract their cost of operations.

??After weeks of wrangling in Sacramento, the front lines in the utility 
debate
will now shift for a time to San Francisco, where the California Public
Utilities Commission will determine the size of the CPA and the way it is to 
be
divvied up.

??How the commission rules will be the main factor in determining if customers
of the three big investor-owned utilities--PG&E, Edison and San Diego Gas &
Electric--will face rate hikes above the 19% already set in motion. It also 
will
have a direct bearing on the state's ability to sell the $ 10 billion in bonds
it needs to finance its long-term power buys without having to commit taxpayer
money.

??""What happens at the PUC is fundamental, in terms of our ability to issue
bonds with investment-grade ratings,"" state Treasurer Phil Angelides said. 
""How
they allocate moneys between the state and utilities will be fundamentally
important to how far our $ 10 billion will go. And it will be fundamentally
important if it is not done in the right way, because it will have a direct 
and
negative impact on consumer rates.""

??Utility executives disagree with the state on how to allocate the CPA but
agree on its importance.

??""One issue is: How do you divide the pie? And an important and related issue
is: Is the pie big enough?"" said Ted Craver, chief financial officer of 
utility
parent Edison International, during a conference call Friday with debt 
holders.

??Before skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices turned PG&E and Edison into
financial basket cases, the money left over after subtracting their costs of
delivering power to customers was called ""headroom,"" and that was where the
utilities paid off past investments, retired debt and took their profits.

??Under Davis' plan, most such money would be reserved by the state to pay off
the $ 10 billion in bonds to buy electricity and reimburse the treasury for 
the
billions the state has already spent to buy power.

??Some consider this a gamble and wonder if there will be enough money
available without either dipping into the state general fund or, more likely,
raising customer rates even further.

??Under the January law, AB 1X, that put California in the power-buying
business, the CPA needs to total at least $ 2.5 billion annually from utility
customers. Angelides on Thursday estimated that the state needs $ 1.3 billion
from CPA funds just to service the bonds.

??PG&E and Edison both say they believe the utilities are entitled to be paid
first out of ratepayer bills under AB 1X.

??The Department of Water Resources, the agency empowered by the state to buy
electricity for utility customers, would get whatever is left over after 
utility
expenses are covered, the two companies say. If nothing is left, rates would 
be
allowed to rise high enough to pay the water agency what it needs to cover its
electricity expenses under an interim order issued Wednesday by the PUC.

??""If that means rate increases, then the commission has affirmed it will pass
through those rate increases,"" said Ann Cohn, assistant general counsel for
Southern California Edison. ""The DWR will have to determine what its own 
revenue
requirement is.""

??In filings with the commission, PG&E, the state's largest electric utility,
insists that once its obligations are subtracted the CPA would be virtually
penniless. The most financially troubled of the utilities, PG&E is believed 
not
to have ruled out filing for bankruptcy as a way out of its $ 8-billion debt.

??What percentage the commission allots PG&E from customer bills could be a
factor in the utility's decision about seeking protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.

??Meanwhile, Davis is faced with a dilemma of his own that is no less
wrenching. For his rescue plan to work, four things must happen:

??* The cost of electricity purchased by the state must be reduced through
long-term contracts.

??* The amount of money paid by the utilities to alternative-energy
suppliers--generators of solar, wind and other forms of power, which 
constitute
about one-fourth of the electricity used by utility customers--must be cut in
half.

??* The utilities must agree to sell electricity to the state from their own
generators, including nuclear plants and hydropower facilities, at slightly
above cost.

??* And the state must obtain favorable rates on its massive bond sales.

??Although some progress has been made on all these fronts, none have been
finalized.

??For example, Davis announced a week ago that 40 long-term supply contracts
had been negotiated with major generators at terms favorable to the state. But
by Friday, fewer than a dozen of the contracts had been signed.

??Moreover, because of the secrecy the Davis administration has imposed on
details of the contracts, it is impossible to tell if the prices negotiated by
the state are low enough to be covered by the $ 10 billion in power bonds 
beyond
September.

??Several California newspapers, including The Times, have been denied by 
Davis
in repeated requests to obtain details under the California Public Records 
Act.
On Friday, Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark) said he plans to file a
lawsuit today demanding that contract details be disclosed.

??If any one of the four key fronts blows up on Davis, the governor would then
be faced with either dipping into the state budget surplus or asking the PUC 
to
raise rates beyond the level now in motion. The currently programmed average 
19%
hike comes from a temporary 9% increase approved by the commission in December
(and generally expected to be made permanent) and a further 10% boost by next
March (when a rate rollback ordered under the state's 1996 deregulation law
expires).

??Davis has publicly opposed using tax funds to bail out the investor-owned
utilities, on grounds that such a move would be unfair to customers of 
municipal
utilities, such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, that remain
financially healthy.

??In its action last week, the PUC made clear that if enough money is not 
found
in the CPA to repay the Department of Water Resources, then customer rates 
would
have to rise.

??While acknowledging that it will be a close call, administration officials
last week repeated their contention that the governor's rescue plan can be
accomplished without raising rates beyond the 19%.

??""Conceptually, I'm confident that the CPA mechanism operates in a manner 
that
gets us appropriate bond capacity,"" state Finance Director Tim Gage said.

??Angelides warned that the state needs to be wary of the utilities' taking
more than their fair share.

??""As the final divisions of the pie are made,"" Angelides said, ""the utilities
should recover no more out of that pie than the actual cost of generation plus
their regulated return, and the state must be accorded the balance.""

Thanks, Sue.  Agreed.  

Also, I met today with Bowen & Co. re: interconnection.  We have some 
decisions to make on that front, too, which will also require a bit of 
discussion.  

Tracy, I'm sure that Scott's in Istanbul and Donald's in Marrakesh.  Could 
you try to track those two broadband cowboys down and see if we can set up a 
conference call for next Wedneday (hopefully, that's ample lead time)?  

Finally, the draft final tariff (in strike-out-underline form) will be ready 
for review by COB Friday.  I'll email it around.  Hope all is well with all.

Here are my votes:

If we have the documents in hand, great.  
If we don't have them in hand, asking Bowen to produce samples probably would 
do quite a bit to speed the process.   I assume he probably has a good idea

A short call to be sure we're all on the same page is a good idea.

Greetings:

As part of our final tariff filing, we need to submit ""sample"" forms for 
things like a Disconnect Notice, Sample Bill and New Service Orders.? Do we 
have any?  Have we had to file any elsewhere?  If not, do we want Bowen & Co. 
to ""create"" some for us to review, or do we prefer to find the right folks 
internal to EBS and create them internally?  Make sense to arrange a 15-30 
minute call to discuss how to execute?  All opinions, views, etc. are 
encouraged and welcome.

Best,
Jeff

I'm adding my two cents.  Here's 3, but not 4.  Few things.  

1) I considered that everything was ""material.""  That reasonable? 

2) Dylan, I struggled with the ban on preservatives, but ultimately decided 
it was unusual, not extraordinary, since the book sez that any write down of 
inventory is unusual, as opposed to extra.  But a case for extra can still, 
be made I think.  

3) I did not include the 1994 litigation expense associated with the ban, 
since it seems to me that it's merely an expense that they would have taken 
in 1994, as opposed to a ""potential litigation outcome"" that they'd make an 
allowance for---I could be wrong, though.  

4) Finally, I assumed that the depreciation-related gain was already included 
in the 1995 ""income from continuing operations"" number, and consequently 
included it as a footnote on my spreadsheet, rather than make it an explicit 
line item in the income statement.  

I'll look at Kim's #4 and if I have any comments, I'll add them to hers and 
circulate.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: Agro - Q3,4


Questions

1.  Litigation - how should we account for the 1994 bill of 500,000 in 1994
- I assume this was not accounted for in the 1994 income statement - we
could include a note on pro forma numbers for the 1994 statement or we
could just include this cost in 1995 - I am including it in the 1995
recalculated income statement, but I don't think this is totally accurate.

Thoughts anyone?

2.  In the text, page 354, Other gains or losses from the sale or
abandonment of PP&E used in a business is not supposed to be reported under
extraordinary items.  This means the two sites Agro sold for $750,000
(after tax gain) should not be counted under extraordinary items.  In this
case - we could 1) assume this is accounted for already in the 9.5 million
number given to us or 2) add it in after ""income from continuing
operations"" and before ""discontinued operations.""  I went with option 2.

Let me know if you have any issues with this treatment.

3.  Are we supposed to do anything with the 30,411,380 of retained
earnings?  I did not include pay out of dividends in the income statement.

SUMMARY
Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of 
the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors).
On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the 
calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate.
A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take 
the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and 
advocating whatever plan the group develops.
Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible 
process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for 
however long it takes to work out a resolution.
It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of 
next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento.
It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be 
brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week.
There was some discussion regarding the release today of ""Plan B.""  Plan B is 
a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to 
the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a 
copy of ""Plan B.""  If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number.
Folks on the call agreed to have the next ""supplier-only"" call-in meeting on 
Friday.
Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ""ratings agency 
level"" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the 
presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to 
issue are solidly backed by retail rates.

The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff
Item #1:  The Credit Issue
Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's 
meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue.  
Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the 
start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California 
PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for 
power services delivered.  
If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow.  

Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution.
It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting 
the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution.
Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The 
following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a 
starting point for discussion.
Utility creditworthiness
retail rates must reflect costs
Increase supply
streamline and otherwise reform the siting process
Decrease demand
establish real-time pricing
implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs
Create a real market
Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., 
once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; 
approximately 3-6 months)
Return the procurement role to the utilities
Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers
Within 18-24 months, create a ""core/noncore"" market structure for 
electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas
Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector
Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, 
etc. 
Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc.
Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that 
discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)",enron_mail/maildir/kean-s/archiving/untitled/4897,13,7,51,6,0,0,12,1,1,1,648,30,72,114,88,4.7407407407407405,61,781,3853,268,327,8
848,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,"
This is yet another, tangible case of why price caps don't and can't help; 
they can and will only make matters worse.  Caps are a policy chainsaw when a 
scalpel is needed.  The result of the caps being imposed on QFs by Davis and 
the Legislature will be shut downs and bankruptcy, which will reduce supply 
and decrease reliability----the exact opposite of what the state needs to be 
doing.

FYI:  I listened in to Sokol's conference call yesterday re: court case 
freeing CalEnergy from the QF contract.  Sokol blasted Edison over and over 
(e.g., accumulated war chest of over $2 billion in cash).  Sokol said that, 
at least for the time being, this lessens the need for CalEnergy specifically 
to force an involuntary.  Be interesting to see if other QFs take similar 
tack.  Sokol also said that CalEnergy has sold the power to El Paso---lot's 
of press questions about price and where the power's headed (i.e., in our out 
of state).   He said he expects to get a ""market price"" from El Paso and that 
if the ""prices are higher out of state, well.......""

Jeff

Needless to say, given the Governor's press release, I'm a little concerned 
about what he might want.  Carl Wood and Loretta Lynch were truly abominable 
at the FERC hearing.  Fortunately, FERC (all 4 Commissioners) really beat up 
on the them.  I'm convinced that FERC feels that they must do something 
between now and November and that if we ever had a chance to get them to be 
bold (understanding that ""bold"" ain't exactly in Hoecker's play book), now's 
the chance.

Thanks for the giving Heber the straight dope.  He was very gracious 
throughout, but after the panel he (very jokingly) ribbed me pretty well, 
saying, ""Jeff, I let you off the hook.  I was going to ask you how in the 
hell you ever let California turn into such a mess.""  I told him that we were 
exercising Herculean restraint in not making lengthy ""I told you so"" 
statements.

Greetings. Forgive the delays.  The meeting can largely be summarized by the 
CEC presentation.  I'll have Joseph email it to you.  In a nut shell, there's 
more interstate pipeline coming to the California border than there is 
INTRAstate capacity to take it from the California border to the 
consumer/business.  The CEC's forecasts show that things will be tight in 
California.  The thrust of the workshop is that, just like power plants, 
intrastate pipeline capapcity is lagging demand in California and California 
needs to make a concerted effort at revitalizing the in-state gas 
infrastructure and do it quickly.   Hope this is helpful, and again, sorry 
for the delay.

Best,
Jeff

Calif ISO Cuts Power Refund Estimate To $6.1B From $8.9B    =20
Updated: Wednesday, July 18, 2001 11:53 AM=01;ET    =01;=20
=01;

By Mark Golden=20

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20


NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California's estimate of how much the state was=20
overcharged by power suppliers dropped to $6.1 billion from $8.9 billion wh=
en=20
an adjustment requested by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge was=
=20
taken into account, according to data submitted to FERC last week.=20

The California Independent System Operator's estimate fell when the grid=20
operator excluded power bought by utilities not under its purview, and its=
=20
estimate could fall again as it works in other recommendations made by the=
=20
judge following the conclusion of 15 days of talks between power suppliers=
=20
and the state over potential refunds last week.=20

Even as the ISO continues to recalculate its refund estimate, however, the=
=20
state is sticking to the original $8.9 billion figure, which has been calle=
d=20
arbitrary by critics. The $6.1 billion estimate merely establishes ""a=20
potential framework for settlement discussions,"" Eric Hildebrandt, the ISO'=
s=20
chief analyst on the matter, told the FERC.=20

FERC administrative law judge Curtis Wagner, who has dismissed the $8.9=20
billion figure as baseless and criticized California's delegation for not=
=20
negotiating in good faith, estimated in his report on the talks that refund=
s=20
due may amount to about $1 billion. Power suppliers offered just over $700=
=20
million.=20

Wagner has recommended FERC hold a 60-day hearing to set the level of refun=
ds=20
and has told the ISO to revise its estimate of what California is owed.=20

The ISO's original $8.9 billion figure included electricity sales to=20
municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers that didn't go through=
=20
the ISO's wholesale markets, the California Power Exchange or the Californi=
a=20
Department of Water Resources. Without direct knowledge of the prices of=20
those purchases, the ISO made estimates.=20

""We know the volume (of the bilateral deals),"" Hildebrandt said. ""The refun=
d=20
amount was based on extrapolation of observed prices in the spot market.""=
=20


Resetting The Baseline=20


Wagner told the ISO to recalculate its figure using only sales through the=
=20
ISO and CalPX markets - which were set up by the state's deregulation law f=
or=20
California's three investor-owned utilities to purchase power - in addition=
=20
to sales to the California Department of Water Resources.=20

The DWR has been buying power for the utilities since PG&E Corp. (PCG, news=
,=20
msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison International (EIX, news,=
=20
msgs) unit Southern California Edison ran out of cash in January. DWR has=
=20
also been covering the needs of Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San=20
Diego Gas & Electric Co.=20

In arriving at his new estimate, the ISO's Hildebrandt also recalculated fa=
ir=20
prices - the baseline against which refundable amounts are determined - by=
=20
retroactively applying the price controls FERC imposed June 19. Those=20
controls set prices by the operating costs of the least efficient generator=
=20
needed to meet demand each hour.=20

But last week, after Hildebrandt completed his $6.1 billion estimate, Wagne=
r=20
recommended to FERC commissioners that the June 19 price control formula be=
=20
modified when used retroactively to determine refunds.=20

Those modifications, if applied to the ISO's estimate, would cut refunds mu=
ch=20
further. For example, FERC's price limits are now based on a monthly averag=
e=20
of natural gas prices covering supplies throughout the state. Wagner=20
recommended using power producers' actual gas costs. Since gas is=20
considerably more expensive in southern California, using actual prices wou=
ld=20
cut potential refunds sharply.=20

Also, Wagner said that refunds should be ordered on sales only as far back =
as=20
Oct. 2, which would reduce the total amount claimed by California by about=
=20
one-third, according to Hildebrandt's previous monthly breakdown.=20

ISO staff is again recalculating the refund estimate to reflect some of=20
Wagner's recommendations, but the ISO will still include sales back to May=
=20
2000, said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle.=20

""The reason we're not going back just to Oct. 2 is that all of the=20
overcharges going back to May should be repaid,"" McCorkle said. ""We just=20
maintain that position.""=20


FERC Baseline Questioned=20


In addition, Hildebrandt argues in his recently released estimate that when=
=20
fair prices are calculated retroactively using FERC's new formula, the pric=
e=20
cap should be based on the least efficient generator the ISO knows to have=
=20
been available, not the least efficient generator actually used to meet=20
demand.=20

That's because the FERC's new price controls require all available generato=
rs=20
be made available to the ISO at any time, Hildebrandt said.=20

Applying that rule would raise the ISO's revised estimate substantially: to=
=20
$7.7 billion from $6.1 billion.=20

One of the ways generators managed to manipulate prices higher, Hildebrandt=
=20
said, was to not offer cheaper power from more efficient units. Considering=
=20
only the least efficient generator actually used would make permanent the=
=20
rewards for such withholding, he said.=20

""The judge is in error to suggest that the actual (least-efficient) unit us=
ed=20
would have been called on if the must-offer requirement were in effect,""=20
Hildebrandt said in an interview.=20

In arriving at his estimate, Hildebrandt determined the difference between=
=20
actual sales prices and what prices would have been for every seller and fo=
r=20
every hour since May 1, 2000, had price controls been in effect. The ISO=20
released only the total potential refund, not the company-specific shares.=
=20

Hildebrandt took issue with generating companies that have complained his=
=20
numbers aren't justified.=20

""These are based on very tangible records,"" he said. ""The idea that it's a=

********************************************

State Senate OKs bailing out Edison from bankruptcy 
Assembly plans own version for utility 
Lynda Gledhill and Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Saturday, July 21, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/21/MN133267.DTL 
Sacramento -- The state Senate approved a plan yesterday to keep Southern 
California Edison from falling into bankruptcy, but the bill crafted as an 
alternative to the pact between the utility and Gov. Gray Davis faces an 
uncertain future. 
The bill by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of 
Palo Alto would give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's 
transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $2.5 
billion of the utility's debt. Edison amassed an estimated $3.5 billion in 
debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained 
frozen. 
The Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last 
night, but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of 
mistakes that led to California's botched 1996 deregulation legislation 
haunted lawmakers. 
Davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk 
before Aug. 15, a date set in the original agreement between Davis and 
Edison. 
Lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night, 
but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town. 
""It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior 
to the end of the legislative recess,"" Davis said of the Aug. 15 date. 
Davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to 
iron out differences between the two bills, but it is unclear whether that 
could be accomplished in the next few days. 
""I have problems with both bills,"" Davis said. ""I am heartened by the fact 
that there's a bill moving in each house."" 
Both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to 
a floor vote, and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the 
process. 
In the Senate, 22 Democrats voted for the Edison plan, while four Democrats 
and all 13 Republicans voted no. 
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she would vote for the bill in its 
current form, but not if any substantial changes are made. 
""The Legislature is ill-equipped to try to craft a deal,"" she said. ""This 
particular measure -- and only this one -- has the intent and clarity to 
protect ratepayers. I'm leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being 
cannibalized."" 
The Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue $2.5 billion in bonds to pay off 
alternative energy producers and their banks. The bonds would be paid off 
through increased rates charged Edison's largest customers and would not 
cover the $1 billion Edison owes out-of-state generators. 
Edison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy, 
which would put it back in the position of buying power. 
The state has been spending upward of $50 million a day on power since 
January, and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the 
utility can once again begin buying power. There is also hope that any deal 
would be used as a way to get Pacific Gas & Electric Co. out of bankruptcy. 
In the Assembly, two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change 
their bill. The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman 
Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, was undergoing changes to 
garner more support. 
Some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines 
and taking municipal utilities out of the deal. 
Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D-San Jose, one of the undecided members on the 
Edison agreement, said the original bill was too complex. 
""It's a cleaner bill,"" Alquist said. ""I think it comes down to whether this 
does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG&E. I would say 
I'm tentatively satisfied."" 
Alquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature 
of the Edison negotiations. Only a few members of the Assembly -- all former 
state senators now in the lower house -- voted to approve the 1996 
legislation, AB1890, that brought deregulation to California. 
Assemblyman Joseph Simitian, D-Palo Alto, said he gave a courtesy vote to the 
Hertzberg-Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee, in order to get the 
measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate. 
""As we've learned from the experience of AB1890, the devil is in the details. 
I have a lot of questions,"" Simitian said. ""The difficulty is that very 
little gets done here until there is a deadline, and then once there is a 
deadline, too much gets done."" 
Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was 
getting rushed, but he said lawmakers are well-informed about the energy 
crisis and its details. He said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings 
and countless hearings on the crisis. 
A wild card in the Assembly's plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D- 
Los Angeles, that garnered Republican support. The so-called ""straight 
bailout"" would give Edison its $3.5 billion through a $2-a-month fee levied 
on utility ratepayers. It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

FYI.  Attached is a presentation on gas markets that I gave to an electricity 
group yesterday.  The group was formed out of California's restructuring 
legislation (AB 1980).  It's called the ""AB 1980 Implementation Group"" (I 
heard that the group decided that its time to change its name.).  The group 
includes just about all of the interest groups in California.  

I focused on the fact that gas offers a model of a ""real"" market that 
California should look to in order to fix the ""artificial"" and failed 
electricity model created by AB 1980.

FYI. In bizarre times, help can sometimes come from bizarre places.  Granted, 
we're likely to disagree strongly with Hogan's continued obsession with 
Poolco, but the discussion in his paper regarding market power may be 
helpful---I've read the Joskow paper, but haven't yet had a chance to review 
the Hogan piece.  

Steve and I discussed the need to do a focused assessment of the Joskow/Kahn 
""analysis""  (remember it's Ed Kahn, not Alfred Kahn).  Seems that it would be 
very useful to fold into that analysis any useful stuff on market power 
included in the paper done by Hogan & Co.  If, in the end, there ain't 
nothing useful, so be it.  But seems like there's little downside to 
exploring it.

Jim, my understanding is that Alan is already working with the fundamentals 
folks on the Portland desk to deconstruct the Joskow paper.  Might want to 
include the Hogan paper in those discussions and might also be useful to pull 
Seabron Adamson into the thinking, too.  Ultimately, may be preferable to 
have any assessment of Joskow and/or Hogan to come from economists, rather 
than directly from us.

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 
This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 
In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 
Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 
But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 
As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 
Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 
Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 
Duress alleged
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 
""We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically,"" said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. ""We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal."" 
Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 
""The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts,"" Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 
""Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,"" Shames said. 
Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 
Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 
He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
""To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,"" said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. ""There were other means to manage the emergency."" 
The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
""First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,"" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.
Willingness to deal
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 
The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are ""just and reasonable."" FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 
Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 
For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
""In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,"" said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. ""We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone."" 
Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 
Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
""The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,"" said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 
The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 
Sempra says contract fair
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 
San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 
Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 
""It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' "" Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 
White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
""There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,"" White said. ""The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 
""But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?"" 
*****************************************************************
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
OC Register, 10.07.01
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 
Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 
The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 
Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 
""We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 
A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 
In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 
Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. ""The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 
Said Freeman: ""We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks."" 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 
Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 
The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called ""peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 
The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 
Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 
""I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 
Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 
Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 
Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 
""I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 
The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 
The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
""It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But ""it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 
Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 
Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
""The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. ""Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''",enron_mail/maildir/dasovich-j/sent_items/480,0,3,18,6,0,1,15,15,0,0,2169,105,82,300,238,4.884739511295528,225,2617,13212,825,803,82

Subject: EMERGENCY CONFERENCE REGARDING CALIFORNIA -- 10/21/2000 -- FINAL 
CALL FOR AGENDA ITEMS INPUT

I have worked closely with Anthony Mazy (Calif Public Utility Comm - Office 
of Ratepayer Advocates) in the past, and he asked me to provide input from 
Enron with our perspective on the energy mess in California for a conference 
they are putting together in October.  (Prior to joining EES I trained the 
CPUC ORA staff on a variety of issues and have earned their trust.)  However, 
I feel that the Enron input into this CPUC conference would be more 
appropriately provided by other members of the EES & ENA team, so I wanted to 
pass this email along to you for your review and action as needed.  

Let me know if my relationship with Anthony and other members of the CPUC 
staff could be useful in advancing Enron's positions at this conference.

any thoughts (and any more detail) we have on demand buy-downs.  I've 
combined our on-line auction proposal with the ""federal"" solution recently 
worked up for the Cheney meetings (I tailored it for California

Hertzberg wanted it today in advance of meetings that he's having in 
Washington next week.  Scott Governor will deliver this to Hertzberg's office 
today.  Sorry for quick turn around, but if folks have comments, could you 
send them to me pronto so that Scott can deliver to Hertzberg's office before

Not a problem.  My concern is less about you and me---we both have views
and are comfortable with the back and forth banter.

I'm actually concerned about Carolyn.  She has worked hard on this, and I
think wants to be involved and participatory. I had the sense that she was
feeling that she'd done a bunch of work that was ending up on the cutting
room floor and that she wasn't getting a real opportunity to participate in
the shaping of the analysis, the presentation, or responsibility for taking
a piece of the presentation for Thursday.  I was sensing that she was
frustrated.

Anil is also less extroverted, but based on discussions with him, I think
that he is less concerned because he has some other pretty cosmic things on
his plate right now.

My real concern is that everyone feels comfortable, understanding that
working in groups is all about compromise, and that one should really
expect to get about 70% or less of one's views included in a final product,
given the nature of group dynamic.

I think we're getting close to something that everyone will good about,
which is a pretty good goal to go after.

Thanks a bunch for the note.

Best,
Jeff

I think it's fuzzy enough that two good lawyers could give two different 
views--wanted to ensure that all analytic bases are covered.  But I just 
talked to Mike and he and I think, at least preliminarily, that the PUC could 
do this absent legislation.  He's going to do the analysis.  Likely better to 
let Mike go ahead and do the analysis and if we want to get other opinions, 
we can make that decision at that time.

One last thought:  If the PUC could do it, that might be Davis' preference.  
That way, he and his people are in charge.  But it may be difficult 
(impossible) for the Legsilature to resist and Davis may not have the clout 
to get them to back off.

		 Subject: QUANTIFICATION OF BENEFITS OF OPEN ACCESS ON ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION 
NETWORK

In discussions with the Administration, it has become clear that there would 
be great political value in being able to  demonstrate (a) the economic value 
of open access for the US and (b) the impact open access would have on the 
current energy crisis.

Enron has developed historical analysis of the impact of deregulation on 
natural gas.  Margaret Carson is putting together some slides that show (1) 
throughput improvements, (2) expansion in pipeline capacity, and (3) cost 
reductions in the industry.  While not exactly identical, there are some good 
reasons to assume that the same would occur in the electricity industry.

It would be great if you could develop a general qualitative framework that 
would outline why open access is preferable in the very short-term and work 
on a larger quantitative framework over the medium-term.

To that end, Richard Tabors of TCA had earlier analyzed the economic loss 
from AEP's abuse of its transmission network last year.  He may have 
additional insights into developing this concept.

Please call me with further questions at 713-853-7673.

Hi Dale:

Please call me to discuss your question.  (415.782.7822)  Customers could try 
to ""bypass"" the utility, but until Dec. '95 (PUC final policy decision) and 
AB 1890, it was against the law to have direct access, so you may be 
misinterpreting the yellow book just a bit.  There were other forms of 
""bypass"" at that time, but DA as we think of it today was illegal.  Give me a 
call and we can try to clear things up (specific references to where in the 
YB you're getting this impression will be helpful).    Glad to talk to you on 
Friday and be happy to talk more if you have any other questions, or desire 
any follow up.  

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, 
        The Yellow Book is in the mail. I read it over the weekend and found 
it to be a very good backgrounder for this whole thing. Thanks for lending it 
to me, and thanks again for your time Friday.
        A followup question: You had told me Friday that the arrival of QF's 
and other non-utility generators, including plants in neighboring states, had 
large customers chomping at the bit for competition, but frustrated because 
the big IOUs still controlled the grid and held the customers captive. But 
the Yellow book said that already some large customers had found ways to 
bypass the IOUs and get direct access/retail wheeling. 
        Could you explain? 
        Thanks, 
        Dale. 
PS - Please don't forget to call Steve Kean to let him know I'll be calling 
him. Thanks.

Even if my diet consisted solely of rare African roots, I'd still go to La 
Folie for your 40th. I understand that you don't want to make people do what 
they don't really want to do, but this is also about you, the celebration of

heard, everyone's cool with Folie. After all, the wine ain't half bad. But, 
I'll be leaving all this up to the Lone Mountain Sisters (and not their

I'm happy to hear it's the man in black's b-day. Hopefully he'll stay around

Today Mona and I attended a meeting of the ""California Energy Solutions 
Group"" (formerly the AB 1890 Implementation Group).  But for the issues 
discussed below, there's not much else to report from the meeting other than 
folks engaged in a good deal of posturing.

At our urging, the group decided to form a ""subcommittee"" comprised of a 
subset of the group.  The group will work quickly to develop a ""strawperson"" 
proposal to present to the larger group for consideration.  The goal is to 
quickly arrive at a ""settlement""---ideally by year end, or sooner---that 
everyone can agree to and offer up to Davis, legislators, etc.  

Our ""reward"" for coming up with the idea is the requirement that we serve on 
the ""committee.""  In addition to us, the other people on the committee are:

Eve Elsesser will chair the committee---Cogen types
John Fielder---Edison
Mike Florio--TURN
Bill Booth---CLECA
Carolyn McIntyre---Sempra
Smutney--Generators
Aaron Thomas--AES (retail) 
Tony Braun--Munis
Ralph Cavanagh--NRDC
John Flory--CALPX

It is clear that one of the key issues is devising the ""benchmark"" that the 
CPUC can use to judge the reasonableness of utility purchases---similar to 
the model used for utility procurement on the gas side.  Chris Calger is in 
the office working on the power plant deals and I briefly discussed with him 
ways of devising a politically palatable, commercially defensible benchmark.  
We came up with some ideas that he suggested I pursue further with Bob 
Badeer, Chris Foster and Tim Belden, which I'll do on Monday.   The first 
meeting of the subcommittee is on Tuesday.

If possible, I'd like to add the ""benchmark"" and ""committee"" issues to our 
agenda for Tuesday's meeting.

As uncomfortable as it sometimes is, I feel compelled to comment on what in 
my humble opinion are quite troubling statements, particularly when those 
statements come from the mouths of self-described liberal, open minded, 
diversity-loving hipsters.  I have a very hard time with stereotyping of any 
sort, and a very, very hard time when it comes from people I'm close to.  
Believe it or not, in the past, I would have been much more aggressive about 
it.  Guess I've mellowed.  Sorry if it made things, well, fidgety.  (I've 
come to grips with the fact that deep down, I tend to trend toward socially 
libertarian and sometimes even anarchist views---oh well.)

		 Subject: PRICE FOR DA SERVICE IN PG&E / SCE

With the on-going discussions in CA, we need to make sure that we understand 
what would happen if a core / non-core split were implemented.

Basically, what is the 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year price for a E-19 and E-20 
customer with a typical load profile?  Has to be all in (as if EES were 
selling gen only service).

Give me a call if this does not make sense.

Thanks,

Jim

		 Subject: Re: Cal ISO Amendment 30

WPTF has just voted to file a protest on Amendment 30 (the ISO is asking to 
be able to buy power for itself in the forward market).  I agreed to fund as 
did 4, maybe 5, others.  The discussion was not exactly as you describe below 
but I will be able to have lots of input on the filing, and am sure I can get 
the points included.  Therefore, I recommend that Enron NOT make a separate 
filing on this.

Here is what WPTF voted on:  Ask FERC to limit ISO procurement only to the 
super peak product that has already been developed by the APX and require 
that the price caps end in 6 months; if the ISO wishes to renew the price 
caps it would have to file 60 days in advance of the 6-month deadline.

Subject: Cal ISO Amendment 30  

Sue- in WPTF's protest of Amendment 30, is WPTF proposing to make the 
following arguments?  If not we need to have Ron give an estimate for an RCR 
and draft a protest.

Amendment 30, which would allow the Cal ISO to do limited forward contracting 
and to allocate the costs thereof to under/overschedulers (protests due 
Oct.2)the traders would like to say that the ISO should not be in the forward 
market, rather the IOUs should be in the forward market and should be 
incented to do so.  Rather than doing anything to fix this failure to hedge 
and underscheduling by the IOUs, this filing would further amplify the 
problem by concentrating even more transactions with the ISO and lead to the 
slippery slope to the ISO running the entire market.  

Since, the filing also creates other problems.  Through the proposal to do 
bilateral deals without first receiving bids, the ISO moved itself out of 
compliance with Order No. 2000 (assuming it ever complied) by starting to 
violate the independence characteristic - the FERC's first minimum 
characteristic for an RTO.  Under this, the RTO is required to be independent 
of market participants.  Order No. 2000 defines a market participant as any 
entity or its affiliate that buys or sells electric energy in the RTO's 
region or in any neighboring region that might be effected by the RTO's 
actions.  

Further, the ISO is already buying out of market and this move would further 
complicate existing problems that we have with OOM.

In addition, although the filing claims that it's request is  limited, yet 
there is no time limitation.  Further, the limitation seems to have little 
real effect.

Subject: New California Filings


There have been several recent filings related to California that you may 
wish to intervene in and/or protest:

1.  CAISO proposal to extend price cap (ER00-3673-000) (due Oct. 5);

2.  CAISO compliance filing with San Diego order to make limited forward 
contracting and to allocate the costs for those contracts to SCs whose 
forward schedules do not reflect their actual real-time demands.  
(ER00-3636-000) (due Oct. 2);

3.  City of Vernon filing to join ISO (EL00-105-000) (due September 29).  
This filing triggers the CAISO's TAC charge effective 1/1/01;

4.  Complaint by Cities of Anaheim, Azusa, etc. regarding the CAISO's 
collection of OOM incurred to meet system reliability and to require the 
CAISO to abide by the cap in Neutrality Adjustment Charge.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you wish to intervene in and/or 
protest any of these filings.  Thanks.  Ron

Greetings Senator:

I'm informed that Mr. Lay is currently out of the country and that your 
message has been forwarded to him.

In the meantime, I am attaching a document that Ken Lay distributed to 
business leaders at meetings in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles about 2 weeks 
ago.  It is the document referenced in the Dow Jones wire story and does 
include the Company's view that a core/noncore market structure is the right 
answer for California (though the document has not been shared with Speaker 
Hertzberg).  

Mr. Lay discussed the core/noncore proposal extensively during his trip to 
Sacramento several weeks ago when, as you recall, he visited Sacramento and 
met with a variety of legislators from both sides of the aisle to discuss 
solutions to California's electricity crisis.

But unlike the Speaker's core/noncore proposal that I read about in today's 
San Francisco Chronicle, Enron's the proposal does not shift all of Edison's 
past due amounts from small consumers to California businesses. The Company 
believes that all customers should be responsible for the costs that have 
been incurred on their behalf.

I will be in Sacramento on Monday, June 4th and would like to discuss our

Greetings:

Due to scheduling conflicts and in the attempt not to waste anyone's time, 
we'll try to conduct some preliminary due diligence via email, voicemail, 
etc.  I've asked GP to get us their audited financial statements for purposes 
of credit check.  Here is some additional information about the project.  If 
any questions come to mind based on this info, please let me know and we can 
forward along to GP for answers.  At this point we have tentatively scheduled 
a meeting with GP's CEO in the S.F. office for Tuesday, June 27th at 10 AM 
(PDT).

A Little Background:
Plan to construct an undersea fiber optic (24 fiber) cable linking several of 
California's major coastal cities (San Diego, L.A., Santa Barbara, San Luis 
Obispo, Monterey, S.F.). Will use a ""festooned"" arrangement (i.e., exit sea 
at each city point).  Total undersea length is ~900 km.
At each coastal city, they'll have a POP to connect to PSTN.
At San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Manhattan Beach, they will deploy two, 
separate diverse cable routes from sea to POP.
Will deploy DWDM.
Plan includes eventual connections to existing and planned trans-Pacific 
systems.
In addition to ""loops"" created in SLO, SB and Manhattan Beach, plan includes 
a terrestial leg from S.F. to Monterey to create a land/sea loop between SF 
and Monterey.
Total terrestial piece is ~400 km (which includes S.F. to Monterey terrestial 
leg).
Eventually, they'd like to secure terrestial leg from Monterey to San Diego 
to create a complete loop.
Has received environmental permit from State Lands Commission; CLEC 
certification from California PUC; and is awaiting environmental permit from 
Coastal Commission.
Expect to have southern portion of system (San Diego to San Luis Obispo) 
built and lit by end of Q1 2001.  
Northern piece likely to take longer due to complications associated with 
federal wildlife preserve off of Monterey.  May end up bypassing Monterey 
altogether.
The people behind the build are techno-philes; they admit to being ""clueless"" 
when it comes to marketing the capacity.
Due to Tyco's perceived lack of performance, Tyco is out and Alcatel is in 
(per Ethan's emails).
They are distressed.  Deutschbank has $8MM in the deal and is pushing on them.
Willing to part with dark fiber for a deep discount.

Summary of the activities since Friday:

Overall, it's 50-50 or better that the Legislature will finish up the budget and recess until August 20th, without having passed some form of an ""Edison MOU."" Will have a better view of the chances of getting an MOU agreed to and passed through both houses by COB Monday.  

In the Senate:
The ""Edison MOU"":
As previously reported, on Friday, SB 78---the Senate's version of the Edison MOU--passed out of the full Senate and was sent to the full Senate.
The bill sticks 100% of suppliers' debts with Edison's shareholders but pays QFs and other creditors.
The authors believe that suppliers can't force Edison into bankruptcy because the claims are with the PX, not Edison, which in their view means that the suppliers can't reach Edison.  Our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic is strong from a legal perspective. 
The bill creates an option to buy the transmission system, but rejects the Goernor's MOU, which buys it outright.
Though there's some uncertainty, the bill appears to end Direct Access.
Information we have indicates that the Assembly does not support and will not pass SB 78 in its current form.
Enron (and the marjority of market participants) opposes 78.

The ""Dunn Investigation"":
Dunn released his report regarding contempt charges against Enron on Saturday.
The report recommends that the Senate fine us, beginning with $1,000 the first day, and doubling everyday thereafter until Enron ""complies.""
Dunn announced on Saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the full Senate for a vote on Saturday.
In response, our lobbyist in Sacramento spoke to a leader of the Republican party in the Senate (Ross Johnson), and persuaded Johson to negotiate the date of the vote with Burton and Dunn.
She was successful---Johnson went to Burton and got him and Dunn to agree not to vote on the report until the Senate returned from its recess on August 20th.
If the Senate returns early, it could vote prior to the 20th, but the likelihood of that happening appears low at this time.

The budget:
The Senate passed the budget at about 1 AM Sunday morning.
The Senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return until August 20th.
That leaves the Assembly alone in Sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the Edison MOU.

The Assembly
In short, leadership within the Assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party--the Democrats.  
The Speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue.
Unable to do a deal, the Assembly recessed Saturday night and has not reconvened. 
It has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget.
The Assembly also has not passed its version of an Edison MOU, which it says it intends to do.
Best information we have right now is that the Assembly does not plan to go back into session until Tuesday morning.
Late Saturday night, the Assembly Speaker released yet another version of his Edison MOU (AB 82XX), but it does not appear at this time that he has enough votes among Assembly Democrats to pass it.
Enron--together with business customers--opposes the version of 82XX released on Saturday night because it does not adequately ensure Direct Access.

The following is a summary of the Direct Access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that Davis cut with Assembly.  Things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly. 

I was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the Davis' and Hertzberg's staff and the staff have agreed to amend the DA provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers.  They also said that favorable provisions with respect to self-gen would also be added to the bill. They said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrow.

Note:  In addition to the DA provisions, the bill also includes provisions that 1) explicitly recognize the PX Credit as part of Edison's undercollection, and 2) permit Edison to pay debts associated with the negative PX credit. (The bill does not authorize Edison to pay power suppliers, however, and leaves that portion of Edison's debt for Edison's management and shareholders to address.)

Summary of Direct Access provisions:

The program would begin January 1, 2003.
It's unclear what would happen to DA between now and January 1, 2003.  Presumably, the decision to suspend, or not, between now and then would stay with the California PUC.
90 days after the effective date of the bill, and every 6 months thereafter, DWR would provide information to the PUC showing the net short position.
Every 6 months, the PUC would hold an open season permitting customers to switch to DA.
20 KW-and-above customers would have 60 days to decide to switch once the PUC has announced the open season; under 20kw customers would have 180 days.
Customers who switch to DA would be responsible for paying 1) the customer's proportionate share of the utility's undercollection and 2) the customer's proportionate share of DWR's receivables (if any) for power previously delivered by DWR (but not yet fully paid for by customers).
In addition, if the number of customers who elect to choose to go DA in the open season exceeds the net short, then DA customers will have to pay their proportionate share of any DWR stranded contract costs.
If the number of DA customers does not exceed the net short position, then no stranded contract cost fees would be assessed.

1997 Robert Mondavi Winery Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve 
(Exceptional) - Epitomizes Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, the grape that is 
the backbone of America's most important wine district. Even at Robert 
Mondavi, which has produced its share of impressive cabs, the 1997 reserve 
stands out. The 1997 vintage was the best of the 1990s in the Napa Valley, 
yielding rich, concentrated red wines. Robert Mondavi Reserve's showy aromas 
of spice, cassis, and cedar make a strong impression in the glass. On the 
palate, the wine is deeply layered with pure dark-berry fruit flavors, has 
firm, ripe tannins and an ultra-smooth finish with superb length. ($120)

1997 Robert Mondavi Winery Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve - (91) Very 
tight nose, with blackberry, coffee and cocoa notes, this is a big wine that 
shows great intensity and depth. Quite closed now, the dark profile keeps its 
cards close to the vest. One thing for sure: this definitely one for the 
cellar. The finish is lengthy, with brisk tannins as well as espresso and 
bitter-chocolate notes. Hold for eight to ten years; this wine should keep 
till 2020. ($120)

elusive wine that one never finds? In my continual pursuit for wine nirvana, 
I have traveled to Bordeaux and back with stops in Italy and Australia and 
for what? Besides losing my luggage, tracking through customs and using 
non-functional phone cards, I have been searching for that wine of 
perfection. Could this wine finally be the one? This just released Opus One 
may be the absolute finest young red wine I have ever tasted in a bottle 
(barrel samples don't count). Aristocratically structured the 1997 Opus One 
magnificently perfumes the air with aromas of ripe, succulent fruit, 
fragrant, sweet earth and delicate, white flowers. Persistent to the point of 
perfection, this wine does not allow its captive audience to escape its web 
of Cabernet ecstasy. Made with the five important varietals of Bordeaux (82% 
Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 5% Merlot, 4% Malbec, and 1% Petit 
Verdot), this spellbinding wine commands attention. This is my top wine of 
the year. (Best Served 2002-2018). ($130)

Folks.  Let me throw out a proposal.  I believe that we should immediately 
draft a very brief letter or press release that explains why the PD is 
misguided and will lead to very bad energy policy for the state, and why our 
settlement is the right one and why it's good energy policy for the state.  
The letter should be signed by everyone who signed the settlement.  It needs 
to be released by the end of this week.  Absent this kind of action, 
nothing's going to turn this thing around.  Spending time and money writing 
""comments"" will be a waste of time and money.  We'll need to do a lot more, 
but I think we have to start this way or fold up our tents now.  Thoughts?

If I'm reading pages 38 - 40 of the Bilas PD correctly, the Commission's
primary concern over the competitive benefits of city-gate pricing is the
fact that PG&E city-gate prices in October were much higher than border
prices plus transportation.  October bidweek PG&E city-gate prices were
high, but only because southern California prices plummeted from the high
levels that they had reached in late August and September, following the El
Paso explosion.  In November, the PG&E city-gate moved back into its normal
relationship with Topock and Malin prices.  For the Commission to be
spooked
by one month of price fluctuations is crazy.

I'm hopeful that my friends at Edison, in particular, can help the
Commission to distinguish what we were trying to achieve in the CS on the
gas side from the mess that is electric restructuring....

Greetings All:
If memory serves, our filing in California is due on Tuesday.  Steve Bowen & 
Co. should be getting me a draft today based on our discussion a couple of 
weeks ago in Houston.  Soon as I get it, I'll be distributing for review.  
Aim would be to have it in shape COB tomorrow.  Thoughts?

P.S.  Some good news.  Recall from our meeting a couple of weeks ago that I 
mentioned that there were some preliminary filings we had to make in Arizona 
(in order to transact business there) prior to filing for a CPCN.  Well, I've 
spoken with Robin Hill, and those filings have already been made some time 
ago, so that's one less thing to worry about.

Best,

Ralph:

Thanks.  Really looking forward to discussing further.  The proposal is very 
promising.  As you can imagine, Enron's going to have two concerns:  1) 
ensuring that eligibility for participating in the competition is as broad as 
possible (paragraph #1), and 2) ensuring that the ""terms specified by the 
Commission that will ptrotect the regulated service and its other customers 
from financial harm"" don't unintentionally (or otherwise) have the effect of 
killing direct access (like AB 1890 did).

Appreciate you sharing this.  You can count on Enron's support.  (Though I 
understand that Enron's support these days is not the most sought after 
commodity---I leave that up to your judgment.  We'll be prepared to help in 
away way you see fit.)

Have a nice weekend.

To get from the California border down to Mexico, you would get service off 
of SoCalGas' and SDG&E's tariff (i.e., you have to wheel through SoCalGas and 
SDG&E to get there.  There may be a single tariff for that service, however 
(rather than taking service off of two tariffs).  I'll try to get the tariff 
numbers and get back to you.  All the tariffs are on Sempra's website.

You truly only have 27 hrs remaining.  What is confusing is the ""entitlement""

moved to SAP.  You begain the year with 126 hrs, took 51 hrs prior to 7/1/00 
leaving you 75 hrs.  After 7/1/00 you took 48 hrs leaving you with 27 hrs as

Hi Michelle:

Guess who?  Just went into Ehronline and noticed that under vacation it sez 
that I'm entitled to 75 hours of vacation, and that I've used 48 hours, 
leaving 27.  I think that I'm actually entitled to more than 75 hours.  
Please tell me that I am.  Thanks very much.

FYI.  Looks like what we suspected is about to launch, i.e., an orchestrated 
effort by Davis to go after the suppliers.  Just found out the following from 
Sue Mara, who attended the ISO board meeting today:

The ISO is scheduled to release a ""report"" today claiming that suppliers are 
price gouging.
The California AG has subpoena-ed generator-members of the WPTF---very 
extensive questions asking for just about everything under the sun.

Likely that we can expect a loud call for regional price caps very soon.

Best,
Jeff

Davis Wants Generators to Accept Less Than Owed (Update2)
2/28/1 18:56 (New York)

Davis Wants Generators to Accept Less Than Owed (Update2)

     (Adds names of California generators in fifth paragraph, and
Reliant comment in sixth.)

     New York, Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray
Davis said he intends to ask power generators to accept partial
payment for power sold to the state's cash-strapped utilities this
summer and winter, Wall Street analysts who attended a closed-door
meeting with the governor said.
     ``It looks like the people he wants sharing the pain are the
companies generating power sold to utilities,'' said Kevin Boone,
a bond analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. who attended the meeting
in New York. ``He wants to force them to take cents on the dollar.
That seems to be what his initial proposal will be.''
      PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, and Edison
International's Southern California Edison, the state's largest
utilities, are near bankruptcy after accumulating more than $12
billion in debt buying power from generators at soaring prices.
Regulators have not let the utilities pass on most of their power-
buying debt to consumers.
     Davis said some generators have approached him with offers to
accept less than full payment, said Michael Worms, a utility
analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. Davis spoke to about 35
analysts from Wall Street and energy-research firms in New York in
a meeting that was criticized by investors and analysts who were
not allowed to attend.

                        No Names Mentioned

    Davis didn't specify which companies came to him with partial-
payment proposals, analysts said. Duke Energy Corp., Calpine
Corp., Willams Cos., Dynegy Inc. and Reliant Energy Inc. are among
the biggest suppliers of electricity to California utilities.
    ``I'm not aware of him talking to anyone at Duke about
forgiveness,'' Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said.
      Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said Davis's proposal
``doesn't really come as a surprise'' because politicians in
Sacramento, the capital of California, have been discussing the
idea for weeks. Reliant has opposed anything other than full
payment of its debts.
    ``Williams fully expects to be paid the money that is owed
us,'' spokeswoman Paula Hall-Collins said. ``We have worked in
very good faith with the state, selling voluntarily into the
market, negotiating with them for long-term contracts and working
with them to solve the problem.''
      Enron Corp., an energy trader that has set aside unspecified
reserve for possible losses in California, has not been approached
about debt forgiveness, said Karen Denne, a company spokeswoman.
      ``This proposal. . . is news to us,'' and does not address
the immediate problem of electricity shortages in California this
summer, Denne said. Industry analysts say California, which has
already had scattered blackouts this winter, will face more this
summer when power demand surges.

                     Buying the Grid

     Davis said at the meeting that negotiations to buy PG&E
Corp.'s power transmission system may take another 30 days, though
he was optimistic an agreement could be reached within two weeks,
analysts said. He offered few other specifics on the PG&E talks,
said Steve Fetter, group managing director of global power for
Fitch Inc.
     State officials are trying to reach agreement with PG&E and
Edison, as well as with Sempra Energy, to buy their transmission
lines as part of a plan to help them pay debt and borrow money at
low interest rates to avoid bankruptcy. A tentative agreement to
buy Edison's lines for $2.76 billion was reached last week. Talks
with Sempra are continuing.
     The governor said he was optimistic an agreement with PG&E
could be reached in two weeks, but negotiations could drag on
longer, Fetter said.
       ``We are making progress,'' Davis said at a news conference
after the analysts meeting at the Cornell Club on the east side of
Manhattan. ``We are close to a final agreement with (Edison) and
relatively close with Sempra.''
      The governor told analysts he's confident he can get a
utility rescue plan that doesn't require an immediate rate
increase, but Davis did say that rate increases are going to be
needed at some unspecified time in the future, Fetter said.
    Davis said he wasn't sure if he resolved all of analysts'
doubts about California's plans to save its utilities from
bankruptcy.
    ``He's in a hole and he's got a long way to go to get out of
it,'' said Paul Patterson, an analyst with Credit Suisse First
Boston who attended the meeting. ``We still don't have a final
solution in sight.''
     Shares of San Francisco-based PG&E fell 9 cents to $13.96.
Rosemead, California-based Edison shares fell 4 cents to $14.90.
San Diego-based Sempra fell 16 cents to $22.15.

Greetings Michelle:

As we talked about it last week---and now that I'm back in the office, I'm 
having folks check to make sure that this is 100% accurate:

Rates for core subscription customers are forecasted (I believe based on 
previous month's gas prices).
Bills for core subscription customers are lagged (I believe by 30 days after 
consumption).
The IOUs face a PBR mechanism that incents them to buy index (though they may 
have engaged in a modest amount of hedging).
The California PUC issued an order (about 2 months ago) prohibiting noncore 
customers from switching to core subscription status.

I'm back in the office today, and have folks checking on this.  I need to pin 
down with certainty 1) the forecast period, and 2) the bill lag period.  Will 
get back to you as soon as we get the info.  If there's anything, just let me 
know.

Best,
Jeff

Comment/Question:  Tricon, an EES gas customer behind Socal, paid 
significantly  more for marketer gas service (IF SOCAL BORDER)   in Q4 00'

adjust for its cost of gas?  Is there a delayed true-up mechanism???  What

One note: recall that with respect to market manipulation, one of the most 
common accusations focused on the problems caused by the PX manipulation the 
utilities engaged in thanks to their monopsony (demand-side bidding) market

manipulated.  Please provide information on whether this was the case and who 
the participants likely were.  What's the current climate regarding 
sanctions, etc.?

Mary Schoen - Any information you can provide relating to air emission issues 
in California, and specific details for our recommendations regarding air 
emissions.

Steve Walton - The status on RTO West, Desert Star, Cal ISO and general 
information on RO development.   

Sue Mara - Specific ordering language requiring the utilities to buy only 
from the PX.  Was it required through legislation or the CPUC, and what 
exactly does it mean.  Who was involved in formulating the language?  
Information on block forward markets.

Alan Comnes - A copy of the CDWR response and anything they might have 
available regarding long term proposals from the government.

Met early this morning with Jack Steward (pres. of CMA) and Keith McCrea 
(lawyer for CMA) to follow up on the meeting that Steve and I had with them 
regarding the proposal Ken Lay was pushing last week:

They like taking Tx out of the MOU, they like getting DWR out of the power 
purchase business, and they think that Edison's MOU needs a little haircut.
McCrea pushed back initially on core/noncore (""why should it be mandatory to 
go the market?""), but after much discussion they agreed that our idea for 
core/noncore has a lot of merit.
Our idea is that 1) the core/noncore would take effect in 18-24 months, when 
the markets settle and prices come down, 2)  everyone (core and noncore) 
should pay for DWR's ""past"" purchases, since everyone consumed it, 3) core 
customers should take IOU generation, QFs and DWR contracts (which eliminates 
the core's ""net short"" position, and 4) noncore would go to market and would 
not have to pay for any of DWR's ""going forward costs"" (since core gets them, 
in exchange for getting all the low-cost IOU generation)
I told them we are still crunching the numbers to see what the rate effects 
would be and would share it with them when we're done.
While they are supportive of this approach and agreed that it would be useful 
to continue to flesh it out, they are not convinced that it will get the 
necessary support to get passed.  They are also withholding final judgment 
until they see all the numbers, i.e., we've still got some work to do.
They are very cynical about anything getting solved in California, and are 
extremely upset about the PUC's proposed rate decisions released by the judge 
and Loretta Lynch.  They place very little trust in the Governor or the 
Legislature.
Interestingly, the rate increase decisions, coupled with calls in Sacramento 
for an immediate move to core/noncore, makes our proposal very attractive to 
CMA.
Nonetheless, they said that they will continue to engage and are willing to 
commit to continue meet to try to get California's mess resolved.",enron_mail/maildir/kean-s/all_documents/4951,5,5,37,6,0,1,14,14,0,0,364,12,31,68,29,4.392857142857143,31,443,2042,161,198,8

I'm fine and agree that it's more about the reasoning than the right answer.  
I don't feel strongly about the recommendation, just wanted to throw out 
something for folks to shoot at and to highlight that A/R and inventory 
turnover is big problem.  (Though without A/R and inventory turnover 
convenants, I don't know if I'd do the deal.)  Thanks for doing the finishing 
touches.

California Retailers Association Supports PG&E Reorganization Plan
SACRAMENTO, Calif., Oct. 1 /PRNewswire/ -- California Retailers Association today released the following statement on Pacific Gas and Electric Company's proposal to emerge from bankruptcy: 
""The California Retailers Association supports this plan because of the many benefits it offers to California, its consumers, and its businesses."" 
""We are pleased that this proposal would allow PG&E to pay the tens of thousands of small businesses who are owed money -- in full, with interest. These firms, through no fault of their own, have been hurt by this energy crisis, and should be made whole -- and will be, under this proposal."" 
""We are particularly pleased that PG&E's plan does not include any kind of rate increase. With our economy hanging in the balance, the last thing California consumers or small businesses need is higher utility rates. The plan also will provide consumers with power pricing stability -- by locking in long-term prices for power at a relatively low price. This will benefit all customers by establishing fair prices that won't spike over time."" 
""Finally, it is critically important to note that the plan is designed to return PG&E to financial viability so that the State of California can get out of the power procurement business, which has been taking funds away from other economic and social programs. The plan also does not require any legislative action or any financial bailout, so the State's attention and funds may once again be focused on their appropriate objectives."" 
The California Retailers Association is a trade association representing major California department and specialty stores, mass merchandisers, grocery, chain drug and convenience stores. Our members have more than 9,000 stores in California and account for more than $100 billion in sales annually. ",enron_mail/maildir/dasovich-j/sent_items/393,3,5,29,10,0,0,2,2,0,0,299,13,7,64,40,5.090301003344481,30,358,1880,119,185,8

The Commission voted out the order 5-0, essentially as it appeared 
yesterday.  Three key changes:
They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers (but the 
entire ""rate freeze"" structure remains intact for now).
The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURN's ""netting out"" of 
gen revenues and CTC collections, and said instead that the Commission will 
consider it as an option in the next phase (a move likely made in order to 
lower chances of a successful utility appeal).
The Commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the 
pros/cons of securitizating the utilities' power purchase costs.  They will 
submit a report on the issue to the Governor and Legislature.
On this last point, wire reports are rampant about the possibility that 
legislation will be introduced as early as today proposing to securitize the 
utilties' power purchase costs.  This action has reportedly been the result 
of discussions that occured through the night between the governor's office, 
the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the 
decision issued by the PUC falls well short of what's needed to keep the IOUs 
credit worthy and solvent.  As a result of those wires stories, the 
utilities' stock has come back (Edison was down as low as 6.25 and is 
currently at 10 7/8; PG&E was at 8 7/8 and is currently at 11 7/8).  We're 
working with Sandi McCubbin, who heads-up our legislative activities in 
California, to get more info and will report back.
The hearing was dominated by highly charged anti-generator, anti-marketer 
rhetoric, which is likely to play a prominent role in the press accounts.  
Only FERC was demonized more.
Each of the Commissioners, including the most recent ""interim"" appointee,  
made strong statements regarding the undesirability of utility bankruptcy.
The Commission left open the possibility of ""doing more"" at their next 
meeting (two weeks from today), which means the negotiations with the 
utilities and ratings agencies are likely to continue. And if an agreement is 
reached, it could end up on the next agenda.",enron_mail/maildir/dasovich-j/sent/2846,6,11,71,8,0,2,1,1,86,86,357,15,31,50,31,4.733893557422969,28,435,2125,149,217,16

and are comfortable with the back and forth banter.

I'm actually concerned about Carolyn.  She has worked hard on this, and I
think wants to be involved and participatory. I had the sense that she was
feeling that she'd done a bunch of work that was ending up on the cutting
room floor and that she wasn't getting a real opportunity to participate in
the shaping of the analysis, the presentation, or responsibility for taking
a piece of the presentation for Thursday.  I was sensing that she was
frustrated.

Anil is also less extroverted, but based on discussions with him, I think
that he is less concerned because he has some other pretty cosmic things on
his plate right now.

My real concern is that everyone feels comfortable, understanding that
working in groups is all about compromise, and that one should really
expect to get about 70% or less of one's views included in a final product,
given the nature of group dynamic.

I think we're getting close to something that everyone will good about,
which is a pretty good goal to go after.

Thanks a bunch for the note.

Best,
Jeff

Hey Jeff,

I hope you don't take anything personally when I disagree with you.  You
are
a
very bright guy and a good speaker with good ideas.  There are always going
to
be disagreements when you get 4 opinionated people together.  Anyway,
please
get
me your numbers by tomorrow so I can spend Tuesday night plugging things in
and
getting the presentation in good working order.  I want Anil to take a
final
crack at it Wednesday so everyone can give comments and be done by
Thursdsay.

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to ""obscene"" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Best,
Jeff

My recollection is that this sheet is a bit vague on detail.

California's gas problems are twofold:

Wellhead prices are still high.  CERA is the best place to get more data on 
drilling activity, etc.

Instate capacity is tigh in PG&E and SDG&E.  CEC did a study, no?  In any 
event California utiilties probably have plans to eliminate the bottlenecks.

I'm not particularly wild about many of the changes proposed by GE.  Seems 
that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.  Here are 
the issues I see:

Indemnity issues:
They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.
Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.
What is a cognizant government?  

Limit of liability issues:
They want to limit their indemnity obligation to 100% of purchase price.  
They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.
They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another party's 
claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).

We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.

ENA Legal (TBD)
1. ENA Legal is responsible for deal documentation and legal sign off for the 
transaction, and is typically responsible for all transaction-related 
agreements documents such as MOUs/MOIs, Participation or Development 
Agreements, and any Agreement, which directs the operation of the project 
(O&M Agreement, Steam Agreement, Gas Agreement, Power Purchase Agreement, 
etc.).  

2. ENA Legal represents the interests of  advises the origination and 
development team (and other members of ENA management as appropriate) on all 
legal aspects of a transaction, accessing internal and external resources as 
required. and reviews/synthesizes comments from the all the groups.  

3. ENA Legal works with origination team, Accounting, Global Finance and Tax 
in structuring the transaction, and communicates with EECC (and others) as 
required during the execution of the project to faciliate compliance with the 
structure.


Recommendations for improving the interaction between EE&CC and ENA:
1. EE&CC Legal should be involved in the beginning of the process of drafting 
documents by EE&CC Contract Administration, unless other procedures have been 
agreed.  
2. Due to conflicts of interest, EE&CC Legal cannot represent NEPCO  while at 
the same time working with the deal team. to procure equipment for the same 
project. ENA Legal and EECC Legal should be advised early in the process of 
any project-related agreements being generated by EECC, so that compliance 
with overall deal structure and risk profile can be ascertained.
3. Comments returned to EE&CC  need to either be incorporated in the next 
draft, or if there are issues on the comments, they need to be discussed with 
the ENA Legal representative or Origination contact, prior to distribution to 
vendors.
4. EECC Legal and ENA Legal should communicate regarding issues common to 
both companies so that consistency in position can be achieved as much as 
possible.  Forms of ""standard"" agreements should be discussed/agreed to 
enhance consistency.
5. Service and consulting agreements not specific to a particular transaction 
which can be untilized by multiple Enron companies via tasking letters should 
be prepared by EECC.  EECC should provide information concerning the 
existence of such service agreements.
6.  ENA Legal would should work closely with EE&CC contract administrators in 
drafting equipment in the preparation of contracts which the contracts 
personnel have been tasked to prepare. EECC Legal can assist by providing 
input, but is not required by ENA to sign off on such contracts.",enron_mail/maildir/mann-k/_sent_mail/1894,5,9,53,1,0,1,8,8,0,0,401,25,44,139,40,5.219451371571072,44,501,2594,165,194,9

I've given it a quick look. Looks a lot different from when I last saw it.  I 
don't see a triggering event on the obligations in 2 a.  Was there another 
fix agreed to by all (maybe the ""as required by law"" language?)  Also, any 
idea why the service charge language was deleted in b?  Maybe it isn't a 
problem.  Also, do you have a copyy of the site plan approval?  

Talk to you soon,

Kay

I just knew you guys got rain the entire weekend.  I'm glad it worked out 
ok.  I tried calling last night but got a busy signal. 

When Michael's school asked for names/addresses of grandparents, I didn't 
know they were going to send a request for $.  Sorry about that!

We are trying to figure out Paige's plans for Thanksgiving, although I'm 
about to give up on figuring it out. She doesn't know if she can get a ticket 
to the game yet. I'm kinda in the mood to cook, but that's as far as we've 
gotten.  Lisa tells me they may be heading your way on Saturday?  We'll 
probably figure things out in the next few days.

We are waiting to see if I'm going to be in town on Thursday to make plans.  
I haven't been out of town since our anniversary, so it must be time to go 
again!  Generally speaking Neil gets home around 600.

Hope you are enjoying the pretty weather today.  I can sure see along way 
today.

Love,

Kay

Good morning. We hope you did not get washed or blown away yesterday. Would
you believe it didn't rain here until last night. We got an inch of rain
then. It did rain a slow drizzle most of the day Saturday. Every thing
worked out great with our company. They fished Friday and we went to Port
Lavaca and Victoria Saturday to some Arts and Craft shows. They could fish
again after we got home. Bobby Clarke's dad is to have the proceduce that
sends dye through the arteries around his heart this morning. He has been
having chest pains. Sallie's mother has had her arteries in her neck
checked out also. Mary's were clear. She is doing fine. I forgot to tell
you we sent money to Michael's school. They will put his name plate in it.
So of course we sent Paige some money also. Do you know your Thanksgiving
plans yet?  I must stop so you can go back to work. Let us know a good time
to call Neil on his birthday. Our Love,Mother

Jerry DeBerry called, and asked that Chris call Liz Evans to get a handle on the correct number for the wire transfer.  Once it is agreed, please send me an email with the revised number.

We were working off of different receipt dates.  I received the fax on Monday, and they believe it was delivered here the Friday before.  That is the reason for the different expectation on the closing date.

Subject: Intergen Consent

Kay-I have reviewed the GE acknowledgment, and I believe it does everything
InterGen would want in that GE permits the multiple transfers all the way to
the project company (Larkspur) and GE acknowledges that the transfers will
not result in a breach of the Facility Agreements.  I have also reviewed the
unanimous consents and find them to be OK.

I propose going back to George with the proposal that simultaneously with
the execution of the unanimous consent that ENA be permitted to exercise its
puts under the two LLC, which can be done with InterGen's consent and
InterGen's receipt of an acknowledgment from GE that the exercise of the put
will not in any manner prejudice the rights under the Facility Agreements
(which in view of the transfer of the turbines and the Facility Agreements
being permitted by GE, such a request may be superfluous, but I'd like to
have it anyway).

I considered also recommending a release from ENA's obligations under the
Letter Agreements, but I think that may be pushing too far.

Let me know your thoughts.

Regards

John

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of the agreement:


How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

I talked to Vanessa Bob at x36781 regarding this matter.  She said she's 
forwarded this on to the JK Group which will pay the amount shortly.  The 
matching gifts are paid quarterly.

Hello.

I gave the Matagorda County Fair & Livestock Association $2050, and filled 
out the form for the match.  Please advise if this has been paid, as they are 
sending me a bill for the $2050, plus a finance charge.

Thank you,

I am attaching a operating lease summary which I have revised to include some 
basic asset operation stuff.  I've left Lisa a voice mail with a brief 
explanation of what we are doing, and asking her if she would take a look at 
this from a financing ""fatal flaw"" standpoint, with Enron being the lessor.  

I've been summoned to Nowhere North Carolina (Rocky Mount) for the remainder

Anne, I hope this helps keep you moving.

Hi there,

I don't know who has or wants to look at the deal docs, but here's the main 
one.  I'm giving it a close look this am, since I haven't been involved in 
this deal for a little while.

Herman, this is the transaction we discussed on the phone a couple of weeks 
ago.  

Lisa and Catherine, I'm pondering the logistics of selling the new turbine in 
the pack with the current ones.  I have a call in to Lee Johnson to discuss 
it with him, just to make sure he is on board. I know it can be done, we just 
have to figure out the paper trail.  

Chip, I haven't received the Hancock letter yet.

Stephen, your close review of the document would be greatly appreciated.

Talk to all soon,

Kay

Would you believe I don't know how late the maid stays?  I think on most 
Tuesdays she comes in the afternoon, but beyond that I really don't know.  I 
don't know if Paige will be here still, but she might.  Buy you really don't 
need to do that, as we don't mind getting it whenever we next come to 
Palacios -  makes the fun last longer.  We won't even celebrate our

Subject: Northwestern

Folks:

With respect to the Northwestern transaction, I'd like to understand what it 
would take in the letter agreement to allow us to recognize the entire $8MM 
upon execution of the letter agreement. In my conversation today with Kay, we 
talked about making sure we could at least recognize the $8MM in equal 
instalments between the execution of the letter agreement and September 1, 
2001 (the outside date for closing). If at all possible, I'd like to take 
this one step further so that the entire amount could be recognized in Q2. 
Let's plan to talk about this on Monday. Any thoughts on this prior to Monday 
would be appreciated.

Regards,

Ben

John,

I made the changes you suggested. 

The prior version contained a non-circumvention (you can't pursue the project 
without me) versus the current exclusivity (you must work only with me), 
which seems somewhat more restrictive since it would keep us from bringing in 
additional participants.  I've changed language in the next paragraph to 
avoid a contradiction.  



 If we go with this approach then I suspect we will want to work on an LOI 
which divides up responsibility going forward. Let me know what you think.

You'll also be even more proud to know the outcome of the following text that 
I sent to one of my Mexico clients -- ""Matthew, with all due respect, clients 
will be doing business with Enron as it is indentified in the introductory 
paragraph and the signature block.  Indeed, as a side note, most of  the 
documents that I have drafted or reviewed always use some form of acronym for 
subsequent references to Enron.  I am indifferent, but I know that the reason 
our accounting brethen made that comment, as well as the other comments they 
often make that seem counter-intuitive, is that it facilitates their efforts 
in ensuring that documents reflect off-balance sheet, soft costs related 
rather than on-balance sheet, hard costs.  As such, I would defer to them on 
this issue""  which was in response to ""Carlos, with all due respect to our 
Accounting brethren, from a commercial point of view, potential clients don't 
want to do business with EDM, they want to do business with Enron.  So, 
please switch the EDM thing back to Enron and everything will be fine.""  
Anyway, I think Herman must have forwarded  copy of those emails to Lisa who 
shared it with Joe Deffner and I happened to run into them outside just now

By separate email, I'll forward you a redlined form of interconnect agreement

Pompano refuses $10,000 `gift' from Texas firm that wants power-plant OK 

By LISA J. HURIASH Sun-Sentinel?????? 
Web-posted: 11:43 p.m. Dec. 7, 2000

???POMPANO BEACH -- The city has returned a $10,000 check to a powerful 
Texas-based company that wants to build a controversial power plant here.
???Enron North America, one of the world's largest energy conglomerates, has 
proposed a 510-megawatt plant for a 30-acre site south of Sample Road and 
east of Florida's Turnpike. 
???Company officials hand-delivered the check last Friday, requesting that 
the money be used for cultural arts programs. The city manager returned it on 
Tuesday. 
???""While your donation is believed to be a genuine and unrelated corporate 
support of the community, the timing of your donation has the potential of 
creating a false impression and perception of its intent and purpose,"" City 
Manager C. William Hargett Jr. wrote in a letter to Steve Krimsky, director 
of Enron. 
???""Therefore, I am returning your check."" 
???The company is planning to pitch its development project to the city's 
Planning and Zoning Board later this month. Eventually the issue will come 
before the City Commission.
???The company hopes to start construction in April and begin operating the 
plant on May 1, 2002. It would be the fifth power plant in Broward County, 
and the third largest.
???City officials applauded returning the check to Enron.
???""I think their intentions were very questionable,"" said Commissioner Kay 
McGinn. ""The city did the honorable thing in returning the check.""
???""We have been talking about cultural arts. But did they do it for 
something in return?"" asked Mayor Bill Griffin. ""The best thing we did was to 
return the check.""
???There wasn't anything improper about the gift, said Eric Thode, spokesman 
for Enron.
???""The city has a right to its opinion. I would say Enron nationwide has 
been recognized for its philanthropic activities. We want to be a good 
corporate citizen and support the community. These are not political 
contributions. Supporting cultural activities, children's activities, these 
are things we have typically supported in various areas where we do 
business,"" he said.
???When the company built a plant in Illinois, for example, it also built a 
playground in that city, Thode said.
???Two cities near the Pompano site, Margate and Coconut Creek, have 
expressed concern about the plant and air-quality regulators, worry it would 
rely too heavily on diesel fuel. Diesel fuel releases nitrogen oxide, a 
leading cause of smog, which can worsen asthma, bronchitis and other 
breathing problems. 
???The plant would burn diesel fuel up to 1,500 hours a year, according to 
its permit application to the state Department of Environmental Protection.
???Hargett said in his letter that he hopes when the plant controversy is 
over, and the timing is better, Enron will come through financially.
???""Hopefully, Enron will continue its support of the community and consider 
a future donation following completion of the various matters pending before 
the city,"" he wrote in his letter to Krimsky.
???Thode noted that the check was not written to the city.
???""We would not cut a check directly to a city government,"" he said. ""Our 
budget has standards.""
???The check was made payable to the non-profit Pompano Beach Cultural Arts 
Foundation, which raises money for city-sponsored cultural programs. The five 
city commissioners, who will vote on the power plant, act as the foundation's 
directors.
???Enron officials met with Coconut Creek City Manager John Kelly and his 
staff Thursday to discuss their concerns about the plant's impact. Because of 
the area's wind conditions, the gases from the plant's 80-foot stacks would 
blow in the general direction of Margate, Coconut Creek, Coral Springs and 
Parkland.
???Kelly said it was a ""good exchange of information"" and he expects future 
meetings.
???""They're trying to be the good neighbor and get into the community,"" Kelly 
said, referring to the returned check. ""It probably came off the wrong way.""
???He added that he was relieved Pompano Beach returned the money.
???""It gives us all a comfort level we're going to deal with it objectively,"" 
he said. ""Checks don't make the air better.""

Neither have us have spoken to GE.  I think Sheila spoke to Lee, but I don't 
know the substance of the conversation.  We asked his permission  on the 
Intergen deal, I believe.  I told Jake last night that there are arguments 
which can be made on both sides as to whether GE needed too consent to having 
the contract distributed to a potential partner.  He said he wanted to talk 
to you about it.

My suggestion would be that someone on the commercial side discuss the 
general status, and ask if it is ok to send out a redacted contract.  That is 
the most conservative approach.

Carlos:  Jake is hoping to get a copy of the turbine contract out to Delta 
this afternoon.  

Do you know whether anyone has approached GE for consent to disclose the 
contracts to potential purchasers?

It sounded yesterday as though the form of contract may be changing, anyway.  
Either way, GE's consent is probably required.  Do you agree?

Would you or Kay mind coordinating with Jake how and when the document can go 
out?

Westinghouse has agreed that LJM doesn't need to sign it.  I sent SW a letter 
confirming that agreement.  Lynn tells me that they should sign it soon.  
Otherwise, the agreement is fully executed.

Kay,

What is the status of the Westinghouse settlement letter?  I thought that it 
had been fully executed but Mitch Robinson indicated that he thought that LJM 
still needed to sign.  In any case, Allegheny Energy's attorney has requested 
a copy of the letter that Westinghouse was obligated to send (regarding our 
ability to increase the maximum output at the Wheatland facility without 
affecting the warranties) pursuant to paragraph 3 of the letter.  Please 
advise ASAP.

John and Randy,

I got a call from Bob Sevitz regarding a change I made to the EECC revisions 
to the Co Op City EPC contract.  Specifically, I deleted language he had 
added to the waiver of consequential damages.  Bob had added a provision that 
said that the waiver was ""subject to"" the indemnification section of the 
contract.  I felt this was too broad of a carve out, especially from the 
contractor's point of view.   Any tweaking of the indemnity language (to 
blatantly reconcile it with the waiver) can occur during the drafting process.

Just wanted to pass this along.

I disagree. NONE of the problems I've had in the last 2 weeks can be 
attributed to changes.  There was no explanation given as to why they booked 
me to return a day early on the first trip to DC. What was up with that? Last 
week, I wrote down EXACTLY the flights I wanted didn't change my plans.  In 
fact, I've spent more time investigating my options by myself than I ever had 
before.  

A travel agent ought to be able to deal with changes anyway.  That is what 
business travel is all about, and has been for the 16 years I've been flying 
around North America, South America and Europe.  I've had good agents and bad 
ones.  The good ones can deal with the changes and never miss a beat.

Please have my flight changed as follows:

Wednesday, August 2nd, change to Continental flight no. 1882, departing IAH 
at 122pm and arriving RDU at 510pm.

The remainder of the travel plans stay the same.

Hi John,

I'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able 
to buy the Fuel Cell equipment for use on projects in Connecticut.  The 
contract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.  Could you have someone 
give it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel?

One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in the 
equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.  I assume that an 
equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway.  Can 
you have this verified?  I only want the simplest of explanations.

Hi Ann,

Thank you for your response. I wanted to propose some different language for your consideration:

WHEREAS, the Gleason Project sustained damage to its exhaust stacks and alleged that Siemens Westinghouse was responsible for such damage because (i) of its failure to, among other things, provide drawings with adequate directions for the welding of those stacks and (ii) excessive vibrations at the Gleason Plant were a contributing factor to such damage.  As a result, Enron presented a breach of warranty claim to Siemens Westinghouse, in May of 2001, under the Contract in the amount of Four Hundred Nine Thousand, Six Hundred Sixty-Six Dollars ($409,666.00) for repair work performed on two of the stacks (""Warranty Issue"").

I hope this gets us there.

attached changes (sent to Peter by Dale).  They are very
straight-forward and will only take a minute.  However, there are a
couple of contracts to which the changes could potentially apply, and

changes.  Please let me know which contract needs to be changed, and

I think your suggestion about the effective date was quite logical, but it 
seems to me that it is more of a Sweetgum issue than ours.  Unless you think 
we have a problem, I'm ok with going along with George on this.

I presume the original LLC agreement  allows for either the Member to sign or 
an Officer of the LLC.  I also assume that Janet Dietrich is an officer of 
both CA's.  Therefore, I'm fine with your suggestion.

Kay:
 
George has prepared a promissory note to be executed by the LLC payable to
SEL but has not received comments from Doug on this yet.  I requested that
he get that to us in order that we might include it in the package out to
you later today.
 
With regard to the date in the LLC Agreement, George proposed that we delete
altogether the ""effective date"" paragraph set forth in Section 2.5.  He is
reluctant to provide an effective date of midnight after the closing date,
as he thinks all of the documents should be effective simultaneously.  I am
okay with this.  What do you think?
 
Per your request, we have prepared LLC certificates using the pre-printed
share certificate forms in the minute book.   These pre-printed forms
provide that the share certificates are to be signed by the ""member.""  We
typically see share certificates signed by designated officers of the LLC.
Unless you instruct otherwise, we will strike through the word ""member""
beneath the signature line on the share certificate in order that an LLC
officer can sign.  
 
Please advise of any comments on the promissory note to be executed by the
LLC payable to ENA.  Thanks.

I wanted to send out a reminder to everyone that I had indicated to Mr. 
Schaeffer that we would be sending him a document last week and to suggest 
that we try to get something out to him this week if at all possible.  

Since our critical final zoning vote is next Thursday, I want to make sure we 
don't give him any reason to get ""up in arms"" over this issue and start 
thinking we have just been leading him along without intending to follow 
through on the deal.  Mark and Karen have done such an exemplary job on the 
zoning (record time) that I don't want anything to get in our way at the 
final moment.  Mr. Schaeffer is one of the wealthier and more influential 
farmers in the area, and has thus far been pretty quiet at the meetings, 
however, he pointedly cornered me at the end of our last meeting to ask about 
this issue.  Lets keep him happy.

Please let me know if we can get it out this week, so I can call him and 
apologize for the delay and give him a new improved delivery date of the 
draft documents.

this point, I am mainly concerned about the business points and the status of

feedback on the business points by early tomorrow, I would like to get those

Lender's counsel indicated to Caroline that not getting an opinion letter may 
be acceptable, but it needs to be confirmed.  As for the consent agreement, 
the one pending issue is whether we will consent to jurisdiction somewhere in 
connection with actions involving the consent agreement.  Sheila's edits to 
the document had venue in NY federal court but eliminated the text concerning 
waiver of forum non-conveniens defense.  We did not present that but rather 
argued against it in its entirety.  Lender's counsel worked on another deal

Kay, 
One of the first things we do after we execute an option agreement is to get 
into the interconnect queue.  To do so, we must enter into an interconnect 
study agreement and in the past we have entered into these agreements using 
the same project agreement that has the option agreement.  Are you saying 
that we need two project companies for each project: one for the option 
agreement and one for the interconnect study agreement?  As you may know, it 
has taken 11 months to get to the point in the Midway project from the time 
we executed an interconnect study agreement with FPL to today when we are

SU was fun, but there was  a little incident with a streaker (more like a 
stroller on stage).  Otherwise, it was great.  Paige did really well, and she 
was front and center for most of their act.

I don't know what we are going to do about Thanksgiving.  Neil and I are 
negotiating. I neglected to discuss it with Paige this weekend, of course.  
It is hard to believe it is only a few weeks away.

Michael and I are both better, although he didn't get better until Friday 
night.

Subject: Meeting between EE&CC and ENA

Kay,
Lisa asked me to see if you would represent ENA Legal at the meeting between 
EE&CC and ENA on Monday, Jan 29th.  Having worked at both companies, you 
would add a lot of insight to the crafting of a ""new project development 
process"".  The agenda is for Ozzie, Mike Coleman, Lisa and you to give brief 
presentations (5-10 minutes each) on the project development process, with 
recommendations on changes to be made.  You've already seen the notes, but 
I'm attaching an updated version.  

Please let me know if you will be available and if you want to change any 
discussion bullets and/or recommendations.  The most recent message had the 
meeting taking place on Monday, January 29th from 11:30 am to 1:30 pm (with 
lunch provided).  Megan will let everyone know which room will be reserved.  
There is also a pre-meeting tomorrow (Wed) at 10:30 am in EB 2868 (it should 
only last 30 minutes).  Thank you in advance for your help.

Nancy,

Here are some come comments to the draft PPA:

As a general note, we would have these goals:

1.  Keep the PPA has streamlined as possible, putting as much as we can in 
the interconnection agreement.
2.  Minimize ties to specific unit.
3.  Maximize optionality, especially delivery points.
4.  Keep construction/ownership of the facility off the balance sheet.
5.  Signing the interconnection agreement must be simultaneous, or a CP.

More specifically we would like to:

Move start up/metering terms to interconnection agreement.
Megawatts will probably change due to change in equipment.  Bracket 192 for 
now.  The capacity will change for summer and winter, also, specifics to be 
determined.
Make sure we are protected from any liability caused by their delay.

Comments on specific articles:
Definition of emergency start up will belong in interconnection agreement.
2.2  Expiration is Dec. 31, 2004; move  bracketed language into interconnect.
2.3  We need an out in case we don't commence construction/achieve commercial 
operation as a result of Buyer's action/inaction, and the term ""breach"" 
should include failure to timely perform any of buyer's obligations under any 
of the agreements. Any reason why we shouldn't want an extension if there is 
a delay due to action/inaction of any governmental authority?  We can add 
change of law as an event which gives us schedule relief, but we might want 
to broaden the definition of change of law. Also, we don't have the site 
acquired yet, so we may need an out in case we encounter a problem, unless we 
will not sign this agreement before acquiring the site.
3.4  Peak period is July and August.
3.5 (b) Amount left over will depend on the summer and winter capacity.  
Might just leave blanks as placeholders.
3.5 (c) Let's try for 4 hours notice.
3.5 (d) suggest title ""Start-Up Minimum Run Time"".
3.5 (e)  add maximum of ___ per year.  
Need a minimum shut down time between start ups.
4.6 Note:  3.3 refers to alternate sources and market sources; 4.6 refers to 
the wholesale market.  We should pick a term, define it, and use it 
throughout. 
8.1 (c)  replace ""covenant"" with ""obligation"", and follow with ""(other than 
payment)"". Default isn't a remedy, so there's a disconnect in that sentence.  
8.1 (d) remove ""shall"" and conform grammar in romanettes.
8.3 refers to LD's, 4.8 but I didn't see any unless 4.8 is meant to encompass 
the concept. A little unclear to me.  How is this supposed to work with 4.8? 
Is there any reason the damage waiver can't be absolute?  Does the sole and 
exclusive language in 4.8 need to be conspicuous, or is it ok?
9.1  Is the demand charge included in the invoice, or is it due without an 
invoice?
10.1 On the third line, shouldn't the second ""Seller"" be ""Buyer""?
15.  No mediation.
16.1  Delete oral amendment language.

Exhibits:
A. Megawatts, heat  rate to be confirmed.  Heat rate believed to be 10,600. 
Deleted bracketed language about implied cost of fuel from alternate source 
energy.  Start up costs:  $500.  Emergency start up to be addressed later.

Could we schedule a conference call for Friday or Monday to discuss any 
questions/issues.  Please let me know your availability.

Thanks,

Kay

Here is the form of LLC agreement we used for the Intergen deal, tweaked a 
bit for lessons learned.  I will forward the updated letter agreement which 
has been improved also.  It relates to the Blue Dog turbines, so some of the 
defined terms are different.  I will also forward the Intergen docs so you 
can see some of the definitions, etc.  

One thing which wasn't addressed in the Intergen deal was the potential HSR 
issue (there wasn't one) which arises when the put or call option is 
exercised.

I agree that we need a ""standard"" way of moving the turbines (and 
transformers) into other structures.  Both the GE contract for the LM 6000's 
and the ABB transformer contract envision such moves.  In addition, the ADA's 
with WestLB anticipate these moves.  I'm sure you've heard plenty about all 
of this.  

I've been working on developing on some of the forms required to take some of 
this - Global Finance will coordinate other aspects of it.  I believe we are 
in pretty good shape conceptually to take care of all of it, but we should 
plan 2 to 4 weeks to get the documents completed.

I don't see any problem with this - I just wanted you to be aware of some of 
the logistics.  I'll be in the office tomorrow if you would like to discuss

Subject: Austin turbines - transfer from West LB facility

It would appear that a number of people have been asked to look into the 
process of purchasing and transferring the four Austin turbines from the West 
LB facility.  As a number of issues need to be addressed and resolved prior 
to being able to execute this transfer, it has been suggested that a general 
meeting be set up to discuss and outline these issues.  Additionally, it 
might be appropriate to appoint one individual to spearhead this general 
effort to avoid duplicating efforts in the future.

Please indicate whether tomorrow at 3PM would fit your schedule, or suggest 
an alternate time/date.  As it is seemingly difficult to schedule a

owes him and that's just a check.  I told him to bring his mother down and 
the others can fend for themselves.  I was afraid I would hurt his feelings, 
but he said he felt the same way.  I will not have anyone taking advantage of 
him.  I'd be the same way with my brother if I never talked to him.  Emma 
wouldn't be nearly as spoiled as she is!!!!  Can you tell I'm hormonal, I'm 
just bitching away.  

Are you ok now with your document?

Yes, STILL here, definitely the strangest of all!
We need to file a current and final franchise tax report, public info
report, and obtain certificate of good standing.  Also certificates of
dissolution.  I seem to remember some of this being done???
CT will charge $172 per entity if they prepare the certificate of
dissolution and file it and $134  per if they file only.  As I remember
there is a TX Corporation and two TX limited partnerships that need to be
dissolved.  Price is the same whether it is a corp or partnership.
I talk to Jennifer Miller at CT fairly often and one of her team members
told me that they could do it on a Technip order and just bill Anglers, so
let me know what if anything you want them to do.
Hope all is well with everyone.

My only warning is that working for Sheila is that she takes over most of the 
big stuff, even if it is your deal. Everything that she is working on now was 
one of her lawyers' deals, but ""things just weren't getting done"".  She can 
be very unclear in what she expects from you.  She is the ultimate 
micro-manager.  She may hire the outside counsel on ""your"" deal, then tell 
you about it later, not consulting you to find out who you want to use.   
This style may not bother you, as you may in fact get comfort from working 
closely with someone.  Clearly, she has a lot of experience to impart, and 
she is very, very nice.  

I'm sure there will be a downside to working with Jeff and Barbara, I just 
haven't been in the group long enough to have an opinion.

The original membership certificate needs to be in the lender's hands (i.e.=

Isabel Parker's office) on Wednesday in order to release escrow.  If you
have the original to me by Tuesday, I can forward it to Isabel by overnight
delivery for Wednesday.  It must be an original, in that the lender's lien
on the membership interest is not perfected without possession of the
original certificate.  With respect to the remaining documents, fax copies

Subject: Anglers


Hello ladies.

I have the signed original (all parnters have signed) of the going out of
business documents for Anglers.  What is next?

Honey, Kay seems to think there is one more form of some kind, plus a filing
fee.  What do you know about those items?  I'm ready to make a final
distribution and let you close out the account.  I'll be happy to deliver
these papers to whomever is the appropriate person, agencey, etc. and help
in any way to stop the insanity.
Can we obtain the final cost for filing the papers, keep that in cash and
make the final checks out?

My Anglers papers show the following percentages, just in case you've gotten
rid of your files:

Alves         21.775
Ashworth        4.265
Bailey         10.895
Dill         10.895
Lockwood      15.235
Mann           4.265
Napoli         10.895
Turner         21.775

And......Kay, before you start making some smart ...comments,  I don't need
the money and in fact I'll buy the first and last bottle of Krug if we can
get together for a final distribution ceremony.

As I always tell Dill (a.k.a. Mokhtar, his new Egyptian
nickname).......Praise Allah.

Business casual is the order of the day here.  Ties are definitely not 
necessary.

Are you spending the night downtown?  If so, you may want to just park at the 
hotel.  Lots of the streets downtown are under construction, so I'm a little 
hesitant to give directions.  Enron is located fairly close to the Hyatt, and 
their garage is easy to find.  Enron just opened a new parking garage, but 
I'm not sure if it is open for visitors yet.  Alternatively,  the Allen 
Center Garage is connected to the Enron building via an above-street walkway.

If it was me and I was working and staying downtown, I would take a taxi.  
This is partly because I have an under-developed sense of direction, and 
partly because of the construction downtown.

Hope this helps.

Hi.

How's it going?

Any more thoughts on tomorrow night?  We could ask your mother to sit for a 
little while.  I think it is pretty neat to get invited to the Enron one.

The head of the power trading legal group stopped by and said to let her know 
if I ever want to change groups.  I thought that was nice.

I'm contemplating doing something special with Michael over spring break.  I 
figure you guys have lots of ""guy only"" stuff coming up, but there aren't a

Here's my little bit of info:

GE (S & S) - I've spoken with Lee Johnson (commercial lead) and have traded 
voice mails with Kent Shoemaker regarding the project specific turbine 
contracts.  I'm requesting a meeting with them on Thursday to iron our 
details.    I requested a revised draft this week (from Andrews & Kurth), but 
have not received it yet.

ABB - I've swapped calls with Mike Sandrige (their commercial lead) about it, 
but haven't connected.  The contract is more straight forward, so problems 
are not expected.  Initial draft of the project specific contracts has been 
prepared.

Blue Dog - Is that GE equipment? Sheila may have someone she wants to work on 
it.  If not, I can fit it in since it relates to what I'm working on with the 
GE contracts.

Austin - this is Stuart's project.

Subject: Turbine Purchase Agreements - Urgent Assignment Issues

Hi -

We are fast approaching the time when  we will need to assign equipment 
purchase agreements to either the ""Developer"" in the CSFB structure, to ENA 
(I think) in the Austin deal or, more urgently, to WestLB in connection with 
a deal in which LJM is currently the nominal purchaser.  The LJM deal is 
called ""Blue Dog"" and ENA has decided it wants those turbines.

Blue Dog-

Lisa has her folks talking to WLB regarding the Blue Dog contract and Rob 
Taylor has contacted Winston & Strawn about a new ADA.   We will need to 
contact GE about the transfer (actually it will be two transfers - one to WLB 
and then into the ""Developer"" in the CSFB structure).  
Who at ENA legal should I work with  to get that process started?  Both Rob 
and I have the turbine purchase agreement and can get it to the ENA lawyer.   

Austin -

The Austin turbines are the LMs - that purchase agreement contemplates that 
the new buyer will execute another agreement with (GE/S&S) covering the 
turbines it acquires.   Is that structure still contemplated?  Is there 
another way to do this that would be easier from a labor perspective?   I 
assume ENA will then be assigning the equipment on to the project company or 
EPC contractor, also.


CSFB Structure -

More generally we will need to get buy-in from vendors on the assignment of 
the purchase contracts.  Is this an appropriate topic for the the World 
Hunger discussion tomorrow?  Are there other vendors who need to be contacted 
on this also?


Thanks for your help,


Rose

Attached is the override letter which was used in connection with the LM6000

This is the type of letter that was included for the Pastoria and Blue Dog

also included in the other override, it is just easier to access here for

Subject: RE: MDEA question

Kay -- The fuel activity is so limited in scope that a separate Exhibit is 
questionable.  If you don't want fuel in the contract body, then why not make 
it a subset of the marketing plan.  Fuel activity is directly linked to power 
marketing when running their units. Thanks -- david

Jim,

Per Gregg's request, I am forwarding ABB's wiring instructions.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Due to the size of this possible transaction, I thought I would keep you in 
the loop on its status.

We submitted a bid with caveats as to its non-binding nature, and suggested 
an alternative structure.  In response, Navigant issued questions. John 
Llodra has compiled answers, which appear to be fine to me.

 We  (Legal) have been instructed to standby, awaiting commercial guidance as 
to whether we will be going forward.  I believe Klauberg has either cleared 
conflicts or initiated the process, so if we go forward, he should be our man.

I will let you know once a go/no go decision is reached.

Subject: livingston county proposed conditions to special use

Following are the proposed conditions to special use which we will be
submitting to the County for their review and attachment to the final zoning
approvals.  Please review and discuss any comments with me or Mark Gershon.


PROPOSED CONDITIONS TO SPECIAL USE
FOR
LIVINGSTON ENERGY CENTER (the ""Facility"")
TITAN LAND DEVELOPMENT CO., L.L.C. (""Titan"")
SOUTHEAST INTERSECTION OF 1400 N. AND 1700 E. ROADS (the ""Property"")


1.   The operation of the Facility shall satisfy all Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency noise pollution requirements.

2.   Titan shall enter into a roadway agreement with the County and
Township Highway Commissioners which assigns responsibility for repair of,
maintenance of, and debris removal on Township and County roadways during
construction of the Facility.

3.   Contingent upon all property owners' written approval being secured,
Titan shall have installed at most four monitoring wells on at most four
properties within one and one-half miles surrounding the Property.  One
monitoring well each shall be installed on a property to the north, south,
east, and west.  Titan shall monitor well levels on each of the properties
on a quarterly basis and shall make such monitoring information available to
the County Engineer at his request for five years following issuance of the
final Certificate of Occupancy.  If no adverse impact due to the operation
of the Facility is found during the first five year monitoring period, then
Titan shall monitor well levels for each of the properties two (2) times per
year and shall make such monitoring information available to the County
Engineer upon his request for the life of the Facility.

4.   The maximum number of power generating units shall be limited to a
maximum of ten (10).

5.   Titan shall have repaired or replaced any drainage tile broken on
the Property during construction and operation of the Facility that would
adversely impact any surrounding property owner.

6.   The site plan for the Facility shall allow no greater than forty
percent (40%) of the site's total acreage to be developed with
non-landscaped areas, open space, or agricultural uses

7.   Upon permanent cessation of use of the Facility as an electric
generation facility, Titan shall remove all above ground buildings,
equipment, footings, appurtenances and structures, including accessory
buildings and equipment. 

8.   Titan shall make those stormwater improvements identified on the
attached Stormwater Management Plan.  Additionally, a) upon adoption by
Pontiac Township and Eppards Point Township of the Area-wide Stormwater
Management study prepared by Farnsworth & Wylie (the ""Study"") for the
Property and the surrounding area and b) upon written agreement to proceed
with the stormwater management improvements identified in the Study by those
property owners whose properties are identified by the Study as requiring
stormwater management improvements, Titan shall commit to make those
stormwater management improvements identified in the Study for the Property.
Titan shall provide a corporate guaranty to the County in the amount of
fifty-five thousand dollars ($55,000) with a C.P.I. as security for making
those stormwater management improvements identified in the Study for the
Property.  Titan shall construct such improvements contemporaneously with
other such improvements being completed in the Study area. 

9.   Construction of each phase of the Facility from initiation to
completion is estimated to require from six (6) to twelve (12) months
subject to weather constraints, acts of God, materials availability, strikes
and other labor issues, changes in regulations affecting development and
construction, and other constraints not within the control of Titan.  Within
twelve months following issuance of the final Certificate of Occupancy all
improvements shall be completed and all construction equipment and trailers
shall be removed.

Kay's venting for the day:

Is it nitpicking to expect outside counsel to (1) make sure the option 
agreement is signed AND acknowledged (2) ascertain whether the thing has the 
dates filled in, and (3) makes sure that the legal description is included?

Ok, maybe I'm whining, but I think Mark should know that we are having 
problems.  Have you mentioned anything to him?

Subject: Confidentiaility Agreements regarding enovate


Hello Kay -

It's been a long time since we've last spoken and I hope things are well.
In November, Gregg Penman had sent me two confidentiality agreements related
to enovate and asked that I forward any comments to you directly.  I finally
have reviewed them and have a couple comments.

The only proposed changes that need explanation are in paragraphs 1 and 3 of
each agreement.  Paragraphs 1 and 3 are typical provisions in a
confidentiality agreement where each side is evaluating a transaction.
However, the confidential information disclosed under these particular
agreements is going to be used not only for trading activities but also in
connection with audit rights related to an existing and ongoing contractual
relationship.  The confidentiality agreements should not affect enovate's
and PMW's rights under the LLC Agreement.  Accordingly, the proposed changes
are my attempt to clarify the usual text.

Please call if you wish to discuss.  I believe my procrastination has
resulted in the business people wanting to sign these up next week, so your
attention to this is appreciated.  Thanks.

I think Piazza sped up to try to get close to the bat.  He's a sly one.  
Roger's first story was ok (""I didn't think he was running, I was tossing the 
bat to our bat boy"").  Second version was a little iffy (""I didn't know if I 
had the bat or the ball"" - why the hell would he throw the ball towards the 
dugout?)

The Turner wedding was amazing.  Jim and Betty Boyd sat behind us at the 
wedding. Mauricio and his wife were there, and showed no signs of leaving.  
When Neil and I left at 130 (Michael was with grandparents)  the band was 
still playing, and the bride and groom were still there.  Unbelievable.  I 
wonder how late it went.

I'm out of town this weekend - Neil's officer's meeting at the Hyatt Hill 
Country, then up to see Paige on Saturday, back on Sunday.  Let me know if it 
reschedules.

Did you change jobs?

What do you hear from Ben?  Anthony called me last week, just to chat.  They 
are looking forward to hunting before the baby gets here.

Subject: ABB Purchase Agreement

Kay:  Brice Golden insists that he has learned about the existance of a 
Purchase Agreement in place under which projects such as his for Ft Pierce 
can add their order for Transformers, without having to negotiate a stand 
alone contract.  Sort of an ala carte arrangement.  I have asked Sheila Tweed 
what she knew about this, and she said she had nothing, but did not know what 
you might have done.  I know we have done bulk purchases and later split for 
the different peaker  projects, and some others similar to that, but no 
blanket agreement.  What have you got?

Hi Carol,

I saw that you posted about getting a nanny.  I've used two services, but 
only one that I can suggest.  For my last nanny, I used Morningside Nanny 
Service, or something close to that. They seemed thorough, and found us a 
wonderful person.  I've also used River Oaks Nanny, but they sent me a nut 
case.

Good luck,

Fred,

Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen 
project, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakout 
contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does 
GE know this is coming?

What are you projecting for a closing date?

 We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, 
price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the 
LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract.  
Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much?

If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.  We 
have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.  In fact, 
I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the 
other deal.  Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm 
sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I 
can get started on the process if you are ready.

If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's.  We may want 
two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.  Kathleen, please talk to 
me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers.

Subject: West LB affiliate registration in Texas for the LM6000 turbine deal

I have spoken to Matt Gockerman in Tax who's comfortable with West LB 
creating a presence in Texas through a partnership owned by Delaware LLCs in 
order to register with the Comptroller prior to receipt of the LM6000 
turbines (which is estimated to be 6/20). Matt will provide the necessary 
forms to West LB/Winston and will coordinate with them for timely completion. 

West LB will be putting together a closing check list for this to occur, 
including registration forms, ADA assignment agreement and West LB guaranty, 
etc. Kay and Rob, can I ask you to coordinate what if anything needs to be on 
the list from the commercial side beside the assignment under LM6000 turbine 
purchase agreement.  We'll schedule a call in the next few days to coordinate 
with Winston and West LB on this matter.

Thanks,
Matt

Ben,

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    



Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get 
it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business 
unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we 
didn't do it with the turbine stuff)

Subject: Meeting to Discuss 501D5A Status

Kay:

We really need to get on top of the situation with the 501D5A. I believe SW 
is now taking the position that the generator was delivered under the terms 
of the contract, and risk of loss resided with us at the time of the ""event"". 
I furthermore understand they are taking the position that if we want a 
replacement generator, that we need to execute a change order. Kind of makes 
you feel like you're getting squeezed...

At the end of the day, we've got $25 million in a CT without a generator. ENA 
will get saddled with these costs if we do not find a resolution either 
through a buyer or a settlement with SW.

I really hope we can focus on this in the next couple of days. FYI, both 
Chris Booth and Ron Tapscott have been drafted on this effort.

You raise a very interesting question on how EECC and ENA will interface in 
the future.  

I understand that ENA now has a Technical Support Group (something like 
that), and some of the folks are EECC personnel who have transferred to ENA.  
I do not know their function or role.   

As for the integration of EECC legal comments into a document, I would say 
that it would depend on the comment.  Essentially, the deals are ENA deals, 
not EECC deals, which means ENA has decision making responsibility.  Also, 
ENA is the project sponsor/owner (until sold), and NEPCO is usually the 
contractor.  The conflicts arise when NEPCO (usually not EECC on ENA deals) 
is asked to wrap certain contracts, so EECC or NEPCO takes a position as a 
contractor.  So it is difficult for EECC to act as the owner's engineer and 
the EPC contractor.

Another interface issue is that EECC contracts personnel do not typically 
involve the EECC lawyers in major equipment contracts until the end of the 
negotiation process.  Perhaps this has changed since I left, but that was how 
things worked when I was with EECC.  

On the finance/deal lawyer front, my question is who deals with the lenders 
and their counsel once the financing vehicle is in place?

I'll let you know if I think of anything else.  I suspect Sheila will have 
some insight, also.

The current structure (including VEPCO in Cornhusker under our Fair Value 
Model) does not contemplate credit support.  There currently is not credit 
support of the actual project co (Ponderosa Pine) under the Cornhusker 
structure.  ENA typically does not provide credit support of project co's 
under the fair value model because of certain bright line tests under the 
fair value model for an asset purchase to qualify for fair value.  

From a bank financing and economic perspective, ENA has a total return swap 
with Delta Power, the 100% owner of Ponderosa Pine (Ponderosa Pine is 
bankruptcy remote).

There possibly could be credit support from ENA for the project co if we were 
compensated a fair value fee for the support, but this issue has never been 
tested with AALLP (would need third party fairness opinion).  In the end, 
there could only be a form of financial support, not a performance 
guarantee.

Kay,
Catherine and I have spoken with the bank about the Notice.  Please have all 
the paperwork ready to go by 10 am CST tomorrow other than the Purchase 
Amounts.  I will provide my last comments to the docs this afternoon if Rose 
will pls do the same.  Approx. 10:30 am CST, Catherine will provide you the 
three Purchase Amounts for insertion.  You will then need to send the package 
to Shazia at CSFB, as Admin Agent, by 11:00 am CST on Thursday, Jan 11th.  
The closing will occur on January 18th so long as our money makes it to the 
Payment Account (Fred and Ben, this is in your court to insure).

I have the September 13th invoice.  Could you fax me the rest?

Thanks,

PS.  I feel like I had previously approved at least one of these invoices.  
We have changed accounting systems and invoice processing personnel, so just 
about anything is possible.

The word is that giving the notice could put the equipment on the balance 
sheet.  If the Coral deal didn't close, the equipment would be tainted.  
Therefore, the giving of the notice needs to occur after we feel certain that 
the Coral transaction will close.

The assignment and assumption agreement have been reviewed by Rob Taylor, and 
he thinks the agreement is fine.

Subject: Coral Energy

Kay,

I will be out of the office for the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday).  
We are in the process of getting the DASH signed -- Rebecca Walker will be 
pursuing signatures tomorrow.

The other outstanding issues are the Option Notice, the Assignment Agreement 
and an agreement with Coral. Have we received an update regarding the Option 
Notice from Rob Taylor?  

Rebecca needs to know when to send the wire transfer by 2:00 PM on the day 
before any funds need to be sent.  In addition, we do need to give WLB at 
least two days notice of any wire transfer (formally 5 days, but Rose 
Engeldorff indicated that we should be OK with 2 days).

 If you have any questions, you may contact me at 713-516-5409 for the next 
two days.  I will be back in the office on Thursday.

Instinctively it seems that the agent for concept would be stronger.  I'll 
check into it for the  longer term deal.  Obviously, it is a Mississippi law

The following are my comments:

  - I assume that Settlements is fine with invoicing no later than the 7 th 
of each mth.
  - Section M:  Should we go this route (covenant of financial support) or 
would we be accomplishing the same if we structure this as MDEA, agent for 
..., similar to that in the Interconnection Agmt.  We should probably look 
into it further for the longer term deal.  I don't know which has the

I'm trying to locate the sig pages for the NW guaranty.  These were the docs 
that I approved after I had approved the letter agreement.  These signed 
pages weren't with the letter agreements and change orders you brought me.  
To you remember if you brought them to me before?  I haven't really searched

Unless the first option expires (and the original premium is expensed), you 
add the original payment to the renewal premium to determine the percentage.  
If we can't beat the percentage game, we can have the land on the balance 
sheet and that won't put the entire project on it.  Don't ask me to splain 
that, because I can't.  If the land is going to be on the balance sheet, you 
would think that it would be better to have $1.3 on than $4.2.  However, one 
thing I don't know (haven't asked) is what the environmental restrictions are 
with our financing vehicle.  I don't know if the land has to be clean before 
it can go into the vehicle.  I can ask.  If it is required to be clean, then 
you may be back to the $4.2 anyway.

Subject: RE: AEW's backup

Yes we do want to renew the option through September of next year and we will 
need to persuade them to lower the option premium.  Her is a thought:  the 
land fill closure cost is approximately $2.9 million.  Could we create a new 
option agreement that states that the strike price is $4.2 million ($1.3 the 
original strike price plus the cost of land fill closure cost) so we could 
pay an option premium of up to $210,000 (5% of $4.2 million).  At closing, we 
reduce the purchase price by the costs yet to be incurred in the closing the 
land fill.  Since Certosa Holdings will not start the closure until they are 
assured that we will exercise the option if even then, the net cost to us 
would drop back to  the original strike price.  Could we get this past the 
accountants?

Only the memorandum of option was recorded.

5. We need to be able to supply from either or both sources (market and=20

failures/delays.

Hi Kay,
 
I wanted to follow up with you and let you know I have confirmed reservations 
for you, Heather and Anne.  Group rates apply to six or more so there is a 
possiblity that the rates will change if they other three guests do not 
confirm reservations.
 
 Please contact me if you have any questions.  I'm looking forward to meeting 
you.

Would you believe I don't know how late the maid stays?  I think on most 
Tuesdays she comes in the afternoon, but beyond that I really don't know.  I 
don't know if Paige will be here still, but she might.  Buy you really don't

Subject: CPCN Update

Sami Salib of the Public Staff is drafting the agenda item that will go on
the Commission's Open Agenda Conference for approval to establish the
procedural schedule for the CPCN application (intervention dates, intervenor
testimony, rebuttal testimony, etc).  Although he wanted to schedule the
evidentiary hearing for the last week in September, the Commisssion's
calendar is currently full.  So he has tentatively scheduled it for Monday,
October 2.  The problem with that is that it makes it virtually impossible
to meet the November 1 construction date if the Commission allows the
customary 30 days after the hearing in which to file briefs and proposed
orders.  I urged Sami to please see if he could calendar the hearing for the
third week in September.  

One of the things that ENA will have to do is to have notice published in
newspapers in the Rocky Mount area for several consecutive weeks prior to
the hearing so that affected persons will have an opportunity to comment.  I
am trying to get Sami to place the draft agenda item and procedural schedule
on the Commission's July 31 Open Agenda Conference so that the notices can
start to run August 7.  That action, along with scheduling the hearing for
the third week in September, will make it far more likely than not that the
CPCN will issue before November 1.  

Failing that, we can work with the Public Staff to shorten the period within
which to file briefs and proposed orders after the hearing to three or
preferably two weeks.  It will not be difficult to do that if there are no
intervenors, or if the intervenors do not object.

Sami has promised to let me know by tomorrow when the agenda item will go
before the Commission, and the dates in the procedural schedule.  Please
call me if you have questions.  Thanks.

I wanted to send out a reminder to everyone that I had indicated to Mr.

Since our critical final zoning vote is next Thursday, I want to make sure we

thinking we have just been leading him along without intending to follow 
through on the deal.  Mark and Karen have done such an exemplary job on the

final moment.  Mr. Schaeffer is one of the wealthier and more influential 
farmers in the area, and has thus far been pretty quiet at the meetings, 
however, he pointedly cornered me at the end of our last meeting to ask about 
this issue.  Lets keep him happy.

Please let me know if we can get it out this week, so I can call him and 
apologize for the delay and give him a new improved delivery date of the 
draft documents.

I would recommend that we not insert Eric's comments regarding the
exhaust temperature and energy guarantees for combined cycle facilities.
As Eric indicates, this is a simple cycle plant, which is similar to
Fountain Valley.  When commenting on the Fountain Valley agreement, Lee
recommended that all references to exhaust temperature and energy
guarantees be stricken and we did so.  In addition, Lee has already seen
a version of the City of Austin agreement that had Sections 10.4.1 and
10.4.3 (the sections Eric would like to reinstated) stricken. Let me
know what you think, but I recommend we leave them out, particularly if
such sections are not necessary and would only be useful to have in the
future if the plant ever went combined cycle.

1. Escrow account. We are still awaiting  closure on the issue of the 
lender's security interest in the escrow account.  A proposal was discussed 
with them to ensure that we could still close the transaction even if Delta 
had defaulted under their loan arrangement.  Indications were that this 
approach was generally acceptable, and Delta/Hancock are to send a letter 
agreement concerning this approach.  This has not yet been received.  This 
prevents the establishment of the escrow account.  We have sent the escrow 
agreement to the bank, but Delta has not completely signed off on the 
agreement.  

2. GE turbine contract.  Delta sent requested changes yesterday, and these 
were forwarded to GE.  I have not received a response from GE.

3.  Miscellaneous docs.  Enron has responded to all the documents requested 
by Hancock.  We are awaiting responses to our drafts. 

4.  GE consent.  Hancock requested some changes to the current draft, and a 
new letter agreement.  GE hasn't responded to the requests yet.  GE has dealt 
directly with Freshfields, so it is possible that there are discussions we 
aren't involved in.

I've left Lee a message concernig the GE items and the timing of signing.

Carolyn, please correct/add anything you think is important.

Hi John,

I left you a voice mail, but thought I'd try email as well.

The language that they added to paragraph 6 raises some issues since they 
want to restrict ENA and its affiliates from future potential transactions.  
Please call me at your convenience to discuss.

Thanks,

I think the easiest way is a power of attorney.  I've talked to Deb Korkmas 
about it (I hear she's the one to handle such things), and I've asked 
Kathleen to identify the most active development entities so that we deal 
with as many as possible at once.

As for the expense account, I figure she can just tell Ben to sign her name 
to the reports.  ANy other ideas?

Thank you for your helpful comments.  Good points.

On the timing issue, we still have the time sensitivity, but I hate to give 
it a precise day.  Maybe the way to address that is within 10 BD's, as 
mutually agreed.

I don't have the doc in front of me (I'm in Florida), but I thought it said 
ENA was taking responsibility for increases in the Purchase Amount as it 
exists the date of closing.  I'll check.

I agree with deleting CO definition.  It doesn't add anything.

Again, thanks.

Kay

Subject: FW: Form for Blue Dog


Kay:

I have a few minor comments to the new draft of the LLC Letter Agreement:

1.  Section 2 - The new draft provides for closing ""no later than 10
business days"" after funding the escrow, while the old draft provided for
closing ""on the 7th business day"" after funding the escrow.  I have a
recollection that ENA actually needed the 7 business days and no less (thus
the requirement of ON the 7th business day) in order to prepare for closing,
and was trying to avoid the possibility of the counterparty wanting to close
before ENA could complete the matters required of it to properly effect a
transfer.  If the timing on this is not sensitive, the new draft is fine.

2.   Section 5(a) - The new draft provides that ENA is responsible for any
""increase in the Purchase Amount,"" if the increase is caused by ENA's acts
or omissions.  The new draft does not mention the base amount or point of
reference, any increase over which would thus be ENA's responsibility.  (The
old draft provided that ENA was responsible for the Purchase Amount, as
determined on the basis of facts and circumstances existing prior to
closing).

3.  Section 9(a)(xiv) - It appears that a verb is missing from this
sentence.

4.  Section 19(c) - I think the definition of ""Commercial Operation"" can be
deleted, since the only place it appears is in Section 19(g), where it is
used with the parenthetical (as defined in the Turbine Contract).  However,
we need to confirm that ""commercial operation"" is actually defined in the
Turbine Contract, as I believe this was the transaction where the term was
constantly used in the underlying agreement without definition.

5.  Section 19(g) - In the definition of ""Take Over,"" replace both
references to ""Unit"" with references to the ""GE Equipment"".

Please call if you want to discuss these comments.  Thank you.

Mitch,

The language in the draft I sent out yesterday reflects our agreement during 
the conference call.  They requested something along the lines of what is in 
the email you forwarded, but I believe they accepted the following language:

SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated 
warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or 
in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 
Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that Enron will not be required to 
maintain an equity position in either of these companies.  SWPC further 
acknowledges that the assignment of the contracts and the transfer of equity 
will not impact any warranties or other provisions of the assigned contracts.


How does this sound?

 Kendall New Century Development, L.L.C.
 Titan Land Development Company, L.L.C.

2.  The purchase price of 100% of the member interests would be:

 Kendall New Century Development, L.L.C.: $3,000,000.00
 Titan Land Development Company, L.L.C.: $6,000,000.00

Lisa Mellancamp was the ENA attorney who handled the CA between ENA and PSEG 
before Christmas.  At the end of November, Lisa engaged Corey Brown at 
Bracewell & Patterson to handle the preparation of a draft Securities 
Purchase Agreement in conjunction with our discussions with Coastal Power.  
Corey prepared a draft SPA based upon an option to purchase structure, but 
Coastal Power backed away from the transaction in early December.

I have received a letter from PSEG Power LLC indicating their interest in 
proceeding with a transaction in the near future.  I will forward you a copy 
of this letter for your records.  They have verbally indicated that the 
Purchase Price(s) of $3 MM and $6 MM respectively, are acceptable to them.

I believe that this is the appropriate time to bring you into the process and 
transfer things from Lisa to yourself.  Please call me to discuss the SPA 
once you have reviewed the appropriate documents.  I will be in Chicago 
tomorrow.  I can be reached by cell at (713) 412-4612 or leave me a 
voicemail.  I will be in the Houston office by noon on Friday.

Thanks,
Fred

Subject: New Proposal by Delta on HSR Fee Split

Kay:
 
I advised Greg Lang that Enron had approved our tentative proposal on
splitting the HSR fee, with Enron bearing a maximum of $25k. 
 
Bill Blumenthal (our HSR expert) has now spoken with Dave Burns (Paul
Hastings' HSR expert), and Bill reports back that Mr. Burns now agrees that
there is exposure to an HSR filing requirement upon exercise of the
put/call.  Apparently, Mr. Burns had not previously focused on the transfer
of the remaining 20% interest in the LLC pursuant to the put/call in his
analysis.  They also agree that the filing fee will be determined by the
fair market value of the assets in the LLC at that time.
 
Greg Lang called after his report from his HSR expert and now proposes the
following alternatives:
 
1.  Straight-up 50/50 split of fees (with no $25k maximum on Enron's
contribution), so that the parties are equally incentivized to minimize the
fee; or
 
2.  Draft additional provisions whereby Enron consents in advance to some
structure such that upon exercise of the put/call, the value of the assets
owned by the LLC are as low as possible.  This may involve transferring one
or more of the turbines to another LLC wholly owned by the LLC.  (Greg
thinks that the value of the assets of wholly-owned subsidiaries need not be
included in the threshold calculation, but I have not confirmed this).  I
indicated that this could be viewed by the FTC as a subterfuge for avoiding
filing requirements.  He called back and subsequently advised that the
solution may then involve transferring each of the turbines to a separate
LLC owned 80/20 by PPL and ENA (to be in compliance with GE requirements)
and that Delta would have a business justification for doing this on the
basis of flexibility to put these turbines in various different projects.  
 
Please advise of your thoughts on this issue.  Thank you.

I had a brief conversation with Herman Manis, and he tells me that there is a 
different interpretation of accounting rules relating to power plants.  
Strangely enough, the change is one which should (I hope I hope) make power 
development projects easier.  In the past, we ran into problems anytime we 
wanted to build a power plant and take megawatts off of it.  Herman tells me 
that the current interpretation now focuses on the operation and maintenance 
of the plants, and not the power purchase agreement relating to the plant.  
This change in focus should make power development deals easier to 
structure.  

I would still like to set up an Intro to TurboPark meeting with Rose 
Engeldorf.  Rose is currently involved in a push a couple of deals in the 
West this week, so it may be a bit before we can get it set up.  A meeting 
with Herman would also be helpful.  Maybe we can buy him lunch and quiz him 
on these new developments.

Hi!

I was off work yesterday, so I just got your email.  You gotta love 
President's Day.  We went to the rodeo last night, and I'm really tired 
today.  I'm too old to go out on a school night!

Mom said that the dr wants to do a sonogram on Dad's neck to check out the 
blockage.  When I talked to her they didn't know when it would be scheduled.  
Evidently there is some unclogging procedure they can do.  Sounds dangerous 
to me, but I don't really know anything about it.

Too bad about Katie's asthma.  I was worried that Paige has it, but she went 
through a bunch of tests and they said she doesn't have it.  Just really bad 
allergies that make her wheeze.  I'm not sure of the difference, but I 
believe this dr.

Michael still isn't interested in playing team sports.  We asked this spring 
and he said not yet.  I don't know why he doesn't want to play, but I don't 
want to push him either.  Maybe I should take him to watch some little kids 
play.  Maybe we can come watch Annie play.

Neil's rodeo stuff will be over next week. Everything else is business as 
usual around here.

Hi Mike,

Sorry I missed you when you returned by call this am.

I have some concerns about the voice mail you left re: assignment language.  
Enron can't stay on the hook for payment if the agreement is assigned, as 
this would bust the financing/accounting arrangement.  What we have tried to 
do to meet your concerns is to see that ABB has a contract with a party which 
is as financially sound as Enron by adding the guaranty language.  This 
addresses ABB's request that the party with the payment obligation have the 
""financial wherewithall"" to make the payments. This is a big change from 
where we were in the last contract. 

I've had a request to get an approximate storage cost (monthly) for budgetary 
purposes.  This is in connection with the buy back arrangement.  Can you give 
me a guesstimate?

Thanks,

One thing to put on the list (which may be there all ready) is that we want 
our officers/directors to effectively resign at closing.  

Another detail (and note who is getting this email):  I've had three

have the drafts forwarded to Enron Legal before the commercial team receives

Subject: Kendall Purchase Agreement


 <<2VCP02!.DOC>>  <<2VCPRED.DOC>>


Carlos:

We have enclosed the initial draft of a Purchase Agreement pertaining to
Kendall New Century Development LLC.  Also enclosed is a blacklined copy
marked to reflect revisions to the form of agreement initially furnished to
us.  We are continuing to review the Purchase Agreement, and may wish to
suggest additional revisions; however, we have attempted to expedite the
review process by circulate a draft today.  We wish to call to your
intention several matters which may warrant further consideration:

1.  Please advise whether Enron has any outstanding guaranties or
performance bond type obligations in connection with the Kendall Project.
If so, we will want to add appropriate provisions addressing the replacement
of such guaranties and/or performance bonds by the Purchaser.

2.  We anticipate that the Purchaser will require some type of
representation as to balance sheet information (i.e., a description or
listing of assets and liabilities) of the Company.  We have not yet drafted
this representation, as it would be helpful to know what type of information
is available, and what type of representation Enron is willing to make in
this regard.

3.  The first sentence in Section 6.3 (the covenant pertaining to Project
Obligations) seems rather unusual, as it is more typical for the Seller to

it appears to have been deliberately drafted in this manner, we have not

Jonathan,

Please resend the draft confidentiality agreement for the Public Staff, 
preferably by email.  I cannot locate the document here.

The LOI with Rocky Mount is still under discussion.  In a recent discussion 
with one of Enron's folks the City (or their lawyer) raised the issue that 
Kilpatrick Stockton had represented them in the past, and that there might be 
a potential conflict.  I don't anticipate a problem, but we should discuss it 
soon.

Thank you for your assistance,

Kay

Kay:

   Just a brief note to check on the status of the confidentiality
agreement with the Public Staff.  What did you think of the draft Allyson
and I forwarded by fax last week?  Once that is signed, we can go ahead and
submit Jeffrey Keenan's cost estimates.

   Also, curious as to the status of the LOI and confidentiality
agreement (draft attached to our last e-mail message) with the City of Rocky
Mount.

   Once these documents are finalized, Allyson and I can continue to
move your project forward.  In the meantime, as you know, Allyson has been
drafting resolutions for adoption by local government officials.

It is worth a try, but it would be unusually generous of the power systems 
group to go along without push back.  At least now we will see where we stand.

Did Herman leave you a voice mail telling you that getting GE to sign off

Hi Heather,

The confidentiality agreement signed by Enron/Vepco states as follows:

Except as required by law, neither party hereto nor their representatives 
will disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations 
are taking place between them not any terms, conditions or other fact with 
respect to any transaction that may be proposed or undertaken, including the 
status thereof.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------

We can loosen up the terms in the contract so that we can disclose certain 
terms to potential investors (I'll make that change), or we can discuss 
amending this agreement.  Additionally, it looks like we have the testimony 
and application filed with the Public Staff to work with.

Bruce probably hasn't heard from Nick yet.  I'll check again tomorrow.  When 
will you know when you are going to NY?  Sunday?

If you need help with a document, say something, I can help you (stay late 
whatever).  That's what I'm here for.  I figured something was up and I'm 
hormonal, so I've just stayed to myself today.

Ric emailed me about whether to pay his mother's, brother's and sister's way 
down for his birthday.  Now, he never hears from his sister and hardly ever 
hears from his brother except when he sends him his monthly payment that he 
owes him and that's just a check.  I told him to bring his mother down and 
the others can fend for themselves.  I was afraid I would hurt his feelings, 
but he said he felt the same way.  I will not have anyone taking advantage of 
him.  I'd be the same way with my brother if I never talked to him.  Emma 
wouldn't be nearly as spoiled as she is!!!!  Can you tell I'm hormonal, I'm 
just bitching away.

	HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--In the latest update of Enron Corp.'s (ENE, news, msgs) 
bandwidth trading activities, the company's chairman said Tuesday that it has 
completed about 90 trades of telecommunications bandwidth. 
	Speaking at the Dain Rauscher Energy 2000 Conference, Enron Chairman Ken Lay 
talked about the current status and futures plans the company has for 
bandwidth trading and broadband services. 
	Asked what kind of company Enron is, Lay gave an answer that shows the recent 
expansion of the company's business strategy beyond energy. Enron is still 
basically ""an energy and broadband company,"" he said. 
	While energy is still the source of most of Enron's revenue, Lay's answer 
underlines the growth potential it sees in broadband services and bandwidth 
trading. A number of Enron officials have been quoted in the last year as 
saying that, in a few years, it could be making as much money from those 
areas as it now makes from its lucrative natural gas and power businesses. 
	Enron plans to spend $600 million-$650 million this year and about the same 
amount over the next two to three years on broadband and bandwidth trading, 
Lay said. It will spend more during that time if necessary. 
	In fact, the company is planning to sell energy assets around the world in 
emerging markets that aren't growing quickly enough to meet Enron's 
standards. Proceeds will be deployed into businesses like broadband and 
bandwidth trading, which are growing more quickly, he said. 
	In pioneering bandwidth trading as a commodity, Enron's 90 bandwidth deals 
put it far ahead of competitors in that nascent market area. El Paso Energy 
Corp. (EPG, news, msgs) officials have said they have done 5-10 bandwidth 
trades this year. Companies like Williams Communications Group (WCG, news, 
msgs) won't talk about the number of bandwidth trades they have made. 
	Bandwidth is the capacity to move data between two points on a 
telecommunications network. 
	Enron will finish deploying its domestic telecommunications network by the 
end of this year, Lay said. Some of the fiber-optic network will be lit, or 
made operational, this year with the rest to be lit later. 
	The company has four bandwidth trading pooling points completed in New York, 
Los Angeles, Las Vegas and London. Enron's current plans call for a total of 
13 pooling points. 
	Bandwidth trading pooling points are facilities where telecom carriers can 
connect to each other to allow data to flow from one carrier to another, 
facilitating bandwidth trading. 
	Enron plans to begin delivering movies to home via broadband connections in 
December as part of its deal with Blockbuster Video and a number of telecom 
carriers. 
	The deal is a 20-year exclusive, worldwide deal with a potential contract 
value of more than $1 billion to Enron, according to materials the company 
handed out at the conference.

Hi Kay,
 
I was able to pull a few strings for you in regards to your upcoming trip.  
Our group rates are only valid for six or more guests traveling together and 
upon review of there only being three confirmed guests in your weekend group 
getaway standard rate rates would have applied. After much begging I was able 
to have the group rates honored for you.  
 
I hope you enjoy your stay and I look forward to meeting you.  
 
Have a great day!

Hi Kathy,

Here are my suggestions/comments on Rev. 6

Definitions.  I think we need a Business Day definition, and a search and 
replace of business days for Business Days.

1.55 The definition of Performance Tests is really a definition of 
performance test reports.  I think we need a definition that incorporates the 
tests listed on Exhibit E.

The phrase installation option is used, but I didn't find a description of 
the installation option when I did a search.

3.14.2.1  Is 6 months enough under this circumstances?  Does it matter?

4.3  Delete ""Each"".

5.1  The amounts on Exhibit N don't match what I have on the last option 
agreement, and there isn't a description of any options, unless I'm 
interpretting it incorrectly.

5.3 (ii)  add ""as provided in Section  5.5""

6.4  I may have missed this, but I didn't see where amounts owed by Seller 
would be charged interest if not timely paid.

10.7  Are the roman numerals correct?.

I am going to email you some new language for assignment and the buy back 
option. You should have it today.

Do you have a redline on this rev 6 versus whatever the version was I read 
before?  I'm skimming it and I want to make sure I don't skip something.  

Thanks,

Kay",enron_mail/maildir/mann-k/discussion_threads/103,3,1,4,3,0,0,1,1,0,0,229,23,38,42,27,4.0524017467248905,34,295,1223,85,145,24

1.  Need details re item 1  below.  Please suggest language (band of acceptability, etc) which I will massage and incorporate.

6.  Do I have the latest draft of Marketing/Risk policies?

7. Bogey calc only addresses gas.  What if the fuel of choice is fuel oil?  Does the fuel cost and heat rate change?

Please point me to the defn of profit by cutting and pasting from wherever it is.  I did  a quick search and couldn't find it, but I didn't do a page turn to locate it.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

Per Karen Way, October 2 is the effective date of the Agreements.  No 
Memorandum was prepared (but Karen would be happy to prepare one for us).  I 
know it is Bart's practice to execute and file Memorandum's for third party 
notice and I personally think it is a good idea.  If you would like, we could 
prepare 2 Memorandums from Forms of Memorandums we typically use and send to 
Karen for approval of the form of Memorandum for use in Illinois and to get 
signed for us.

Please advise.

Please call Karen Way at Piper Rudnick and follow up on the points you

well check with Karen to see if there is a reason she didn't date it.

Good job.

Subject: Ledford and Fehr (Illinois Options)

Kay,

When the Ledford's and Fehr's signed the Option Agreements, they did not date 
on the signature page however, October 2, 2000 was inserted on page 1 (the 
Cover Sheet).  Can I insert October 2, 2000 as the effective date on the 
signatue pages?

Also, Paragraph 15 of the Option Agreements refers to a Memorandum to be 
executed and recorded in the office of Recorder of Deeds.  Do you know where 
these documents are?  It may be that outside counsel has them and will record 
them.  If not, I guess we should follow up?

I believe the payment schedule on the spread sheet previously given to AK is 
correct.  If there is a conflict, change order 4 takes precedence as to the 
timing of the payments.  At least 10% has been paid on these turbines, so I 
don't understand the 5% question.

Rebecca Walker is preparing an updated payment schedule for all the break out 
contracts.

My personal preference is to not spend the money to check out the licensing

opinion, and I had assumed that it had been communicated to you.  Sorry about

Gentlemen,

Things are heating up, no pun intended. Therefore, it would be helpful if you 
would prepare a closing list for the GE turbines moving out of WestLB.  I 
know it is short, but I thrive on lists.

I cannot tell you how many calls I've swapped with ABB's rep about that 
contract, without ever hooking up.  I see that we will be facing a fire drill 
quickly in getting at least some of these transformers into the right 
financing vehicle.  Therefore, please prepare a list of site specific issues 
for that document as well.

Thanks,

Kay",enron_mail/maildir/mann-k/sent/1478,4,1,7,5,0,0,2,0,0,0,99,6,15,19,7,4.292929292929293,13,125,550,41,79,0

CC,

Do you still have the contact info for the escrow agent?  If so, it would be  
great it you would contact them directly.

The turbine contract is going back and forth between us and GE.  I expect 
that it may well be ready tomorrow.

I expect the Enron opinion letter to be an issue.

Subject: Delta Timetable


Kay:

Note the following timetable from the final version of the ENA/PPL letter
agreement:

(1)  ENA agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the final
form of the turbine contract on or before April 11, 2001.
(2)  The parties agreed to commercially reasonable efforts to execute an
escrow agreement on or before April 16, 2001.
(3)  The escrow account must be funded 3 business days after the later of
(a) ENA's delivery of the final form of the turbine contract and (b) the
closing of PPL's financing.
(4)  ENA can terminate if the escrow is not funded on or before April 19,
2001 (but this date gets pushed back by one business day for each business
day beyond April 11, 2001 that ENA delivers the final form of the turbine
contract).
(5)  The closing occurs at least 5, but not later than 10, business days
after funding the escrow account.
(6)  Either party may terminate if the closing has not occurred on or before
May 3, 2001.

If ENA delivers the final form of the turbine contract on April 11, 2001,
then the April 19, 2001 right to terminate stands.  PPL's obligation to fund
the escrow would then be determined by the date of its loan closing.  Greg
Lang advises that they are working on PPL's financing, but he did not give
an estimated date for financial closing.  

I advised Greg on Friday that the legal opinions from both GE and Enron were
causing heartburn.  He agreed to pass this along to Isabel Parker.  He asked
today about GE's reaction to the consent document and if it would be
appropriate for Isabel Parker to contact GE directly at this point.  He also
requested a draft of the escrow disbursement instructions.  When you get a
chance, please advise of any comments in order that we can circulate for
PPL's review.  Also, we need to contact Citibank to clear the proposed form
of escrow agreement (and the anticipated disbursement instructions) and to
negotiate the fee.  Let me know if we can assist in this regard.  Thanks.

Hi Marisa,

Please send the forms to Carlos also since for 2, 3, and 4 we will use the 
same forms. Obviously, we want the economy of doing this once for both 
transactions.  Also, please bill the time for these forms to Carlos' deal, 
since Blue Dog is paying for some of the development of the letter agreement 
and the llc forms.

It sure sounds like we won't be tendering a facility agreement, but until the 
structure is agreed I would keep the letters in as place holders.

Once the LLC is formed you will get the complete corporate books which will 
have the certificates.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

Later this afternoon, I plan to send you preliminary drafts of the following
documents:

1. Revised Letter Agreement;
2. Escrow Agreement;
3. Guaranty Agreement; and
4. Promissory Note by LLC payable to ENA.

In the meantime, I had a couple of questions. First, since the Blue Dog deal
is a wholesale assignment of a contract, will I still need to prepare items
7 and 8 on the closing checklist (letter from ENA to Prospective Buyer to
deliver the form of Facility Agreement and letter from Buyer to ENA to
advise regarding the Form of Facility Agreement).  Second, will you send me
the blank certificates that will serve as the Membership Certificates for
the LLC?  Carolyn mentioned that, in the past, these certificates have come
from an Enron Stock Book.

Thanks,

Marisa

Mitch,

The language in the draft I sent out yesterday reflects our agreement during 
the conference call.  They requested something along the lines of what is in 
the email you forwarded, but I believe they accepted the following language:

SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated 
warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or 
in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 
Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that Enron will not be required to 
maintain an equity position in either of these companies.  SWPC further 
acknowledges that the assignment of the contracts and the transfer of equity 
will not impact any warranties or other provisions of the assigned contracts.


How does this sound?

Kay

I think all of us who deal with assets are running across confidentiality 
hurdles in all kinds of agreements, including confidentiality agreements.  In 
short, our business people need the ability to disclose agreements to 
potential purchasers of projects, contracts and assets, and not all of our 
forms allow this.

I'm trying to include an exception for ""potential lenders and investors"" 
whenever I can (instead of just lenders). Does someone have a more artful or 
effective solution?  

Just wanted to share the thought so that more eyes could be watching for the 
issue.

Of course, this doesn't apply to any funds held in a jointly owned  bank or 
trust account, right?  And when you say ""do not"", what do you mean?  Does 
that mean do or does it mean not?  You are confusing me. What does ""is"" mean, 
after all?

As I'm sure you recall, Bob Vote handled the last one.  Richard Sanders is 
the EWS litagation manager, so Mark would probably like for him to know about

Subject: URGENT STOP PAYMENT: Writ of Garnishment of money due CIGSA served 
on EECC on April 10

EECC has just been served with a writ of garnishment from the 333rd Judicial 
District Court of Harris County  in connection with a judgment against 
certain CIGSA entities. In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very 
plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to 
CIGSA pending further orders from  the court. The writ was issued to enforce 
an judgment  for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of 
Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list 
all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,  and to 
disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or 
assets.  The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully 
garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment 
creditors. 

Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be 
entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where 
the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or 
Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more 
accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY 
payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any 
CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may 
impose penalties for violations  of its garnishment order.

We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy 
Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and 
Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control 
teams on  this matter ASAP.

Kay:

The enclosed ENA Consent looks fine to me, but you may wish to run this by
Sheila Tweed, as she had a specific request on the NY court jurisdiction
language.  We initially advised Isabel Parker that Enron would accept NY
federal court jurisdiction but not jurisdiction of NY state courts.  She did
not take our comment, and Enron subsequently said it would accept
jurisdiction of commercial courts in Manhattan, but not state courts
generally (language suggested by Sheila Tweed through Carlos Sole).   Isabel
has drafted the revised version to delete reference to NY state courts
altogether and to limit the federal courts reference to those located in the
borough of Manhattan.  Please review and advise.

Just wanted you to know that I received your email, and will follow through 
on the change order.  I should be in the office on Thursday am, if not

I reviewed your email re: VEPCO. We do have a project entity to use, and 
Accounting (and Global Finace) have been involved on the MTM and off  balance 
sheet issues.  I suspect we will find out about the need for a guarantee

It was good to get your input on VEPCO. There's lots to do on that one.

Subject: Pontiac Land Option

Our current land option on the Pontiac site goes to June 11th, with a 6 month 
extension for $5000.  In order to enhance and maintain the value of the site 
(we're trying to sell it now) I have gotten Ben's authorization to secure an 
additional 12 month extension on the deal for $10,000.

I spoke to the landowner - Dick Greene - and he indicated that they would 
consider it, although he has never been in favor of an option structure 
since  he is 80 years old and just wants the money from the sale.  The 
concept I pitched today was that we would pay them for the 6 month extension, 
and give them an additional $5000 now in exchange for adding another 12 month 
extension on the back.  At the time we exercise that 12 month extension we 
would pay them another $5000.  He said he would have to hear what his lawyer 
said in this regard, but I think its close to a deal.  Perhaps we could 
arrange a conference call with Karen Way at Piper-Rudnick as she has dealt 
extensively with their lawyer Ed Legner.  Its good timing to hit him now, 
since he does a lot of tax work so he will want to wrap us up quickly.

As regards accounting issues, the total exercise price is 117 acres * $4500 / 
ac. = $526,500, and 5% = $26,325.  Total option premiums (including this 
extension I am proposing) will be $20,000.  I believe we may also need to 
amend the original option language to make it clear that the option fee is 
not part of the price.

Kay, I called Cingular to see what was up with your bill.  The last payment 
was made the end of March.  Your credit card expired March, 2001.  So, you 
are not set up currently for your credit card to be charged.  I'm going to go 
ahead and expense this charge and then you'll need to pay it.  If you want it 
set up again on your credit card, you have to send Cingular a letter stating 
your wishes.

I also changed your address to this building while I had her on the phone.

I disagree. NONE of the problems I've had in the last 2 weeks can be 
attributed to changes.  There was no explanation given as to why they booked 
me to return a day early on the first trip to DC. What was up with that? Last 
week, I wrote down EXACTLY the flights I wanted didn't change my plans.  In 
fact, I've spent more time investigating my options by myself than I ever had 
before.  

A travel agent ought to be able to deal with changes anyway.  That is what 
business travel is all about, and has been for the 16 years I've been flying 
around North America, South America and Europe.  I've had good agents and bad 
ones.  The good ones can deal with the changes and never miss a beat.

Please have my flight changed as follows:

Wednesday, August 2nd, change to Continental flight no. 1882, departing IAH 
at 122pm and arriving RDU at 510pm.

The remainder of the travel plans stay the same.

Do you still have the contact info for the escrow agent?  If so, it would be  
great it you would contact them directly.

The turbine contract is going back and forth between us and GE.  I expect 
that it may well be ready tomorrow.

I expect the Enron opinion letter to be an issue.

Subject: Delta Timetable


Kay:

Note the following timetable from the final version of the ENA/PPL letter
agreement:

(1)  ENA agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the final
form of the turbine contract on or before April 11, 2001.
(2)  The parties agreed to commercially reasonable efforts to execute an
escrow agreement on or before April 16, 2001.
(3)  The escrow account must be funded 3 business days after the later of
(a) ENA's delivery of the final form of the turbine contract and (b) the
closing of PPL's financing.
(4)  ENA can terminate if the escrow is not funded on or before April 19,
2001 (but this date gets pushed back by one business day for each business
day beyond April 11, 2001 that ENA delivers the final form of the turbine
contract).
(5)  The closing occurs at least 5, but not later than 10, business days
after funding the escrow account.
(6)  Either party may terminate if the closing has not occurred on or before
May 3, 2001.

If ENA delivers the final form of the turbine contract on April 11, 2001,
then the April 19, 2001 right to terminate stands.  PPL's obligation to fund
the escrow would then be determined by the date of its loan closing.  Greg
Lang advises that they are working on PPL's financing, but he did not give
an estimated date for financial closing.  

I advised Greg on Friday that the legal opinions from both GE and Enron were
causing heartburn.  He agreed to pass this along to Isabel Parker.  He asked
today about GE's reaction to the consent document and if it would be
appropriate for Isabel Parker to contact GE directly at this point.  He also
requested a draft of the escrow disbursement instructions.  When you get a
chance, please advise of any comments in order that we can circulate for
PPL's review.  Also, we need to contact Citibank to clear the proposed form
of escrow agreement (and the anticipated disbursement instructions) and to
negotiate the fee.  Let me know if we can assist in this regard.  Thanks.

I wish I could say that's the reason we haven't heard anything. I suspect we 
would have heard if they had a problem with it being WordPerfect.  I hope 
this doesn't mean they haven't tried to open it yet.

I have complained about EECC Contracts using WordPerfect.  As far as I know, 
it is the ONLY Enron group still using it.  EECC Legal uses Word.  I always 
figured this WordPerfect thing was intentional, which is why I had 
WordPerfect loaded on my computer.

I don't think I can make the conversion from home due to download problems.

	FuelCell Energy Announces Two Contract Awards
Thursday, November 2, 2000 07:07 AM	?Mail this article to a friend 
	DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 2, 2000-- 
	New, Specialized Applications for Direct FuelCell(TM) Power Plants 
	FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: FCEL, news, msgs) announced the award of 
contracts for two new power plants using the company's Direct FuelCells(R) 
(DFC(R)) for coal mine and remote location applications. The first contract 
is for a $5.4 million project with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 
National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for the design, construction and 
operation of a 250 kW DFC, utilizing coal mine methane gas, at the Harrison 
Mining Corporation coal mine in Cadiz, Ohio. The second contract, for 
$100,000, is from the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center in 
Groton, Connecticut for a remote location, 3 kW fuel cell power system, using 
methanol for fuel. It is scheduled to be installed during the second quarter 
of 2001 at the Cape Henry Lighthouse at Fort Story, near Virginia Beach, VA. 
	Coal Mine Methane: Cost-Free Fuel Reduces Emissions 
	FuelCell Energy was selected for the coal mine methane emission reduction 
project to demonstrate the ability of the DFC to generate electricity, using 
coal mine methane emissions that otherwise escape into the atmosphere. Costs 
for the three-year program will be shared equally by the DOE and FuelCell 
Energy. As a result, in addition to the environmental benefits of reducing 
emissions, the cost of electricity produced from coal mine methane is reduced 
by using a fuel that is essentially free. 
	""The DOE has been supporting the development of fuel cells for more than two 
decades,"" said Mark C. Williams, fuel cell product manager for NETL. ""This 
application to coal mine methane effectively combines efficient power 
generation with a solution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions."" 
	According to FuelCell Energy, 75% of the world's coal mine methane emissions 
from active and abandoned coal mines comes from the top six countries with 
coal mining operations. A total of approximately 1,000 megawatts of fuel cell 
power could be generated using coal mine methane from the two sources. The 
U.S., alone, has approximately 300 megawatts of unutilized coal mine methane 
capacity. At an estimated $1,000 kW, the 1,000 MW worldwide potential for 
FuelCell Energy fuel cell power plants is equivalent to a $1.0 billion 
market. 
	""The use of coal mine methane to power Direct FuelCells will result in 
benefits for all concerned,"" said Jerry D. Leitman, president and CEO of 
FuelCell Energy. ""Coal mine methane is a greenhouse gas which can be 
remediated. By using it to fuel a DFC power plant, a customer turns a 
liability into an asset that gets rid of a polluting gas and produces 
electric power in an environmentally responsible fashion. An important 
milestone for the company is to identify prospective early-adopter markets. 
The coal mine methane market provides a virtually free fuel source to operate 
the fuel cells, facilitating early adoption by energy users."" 
	Remote Power: Clean Energy Where the Wires End 
	The U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center has awarded FuelCell 
Energy a $100,000 contract to provide a 3 kW DFC power plant at the Cape 
Henry Lighthouse, for a field test at the lighthouse to demonstrate fuel cell 
capabilities at remote sites. The Coast Guard operates several hundred 
unattended power systems at remote site communication stations, radio 
navigation stations, weather stations, and aids to navigation such as 
lighthouses, structures, and buoys. Stand alone fuel cell power systems offer 
efficiency and environmental advantages for remote site operation. The 
methanol fuel allows for simpler, more compact process equipment for FuelCell 
Energy's Direct FuelCell plant compared to other fuel sources. 
	""This demonstration project by FuelCell Energy is the first application of 
fuel cells at a remote, unmanned site in a marine environment"", said Walt 
Lincoln, project manager of the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development 
Center. ""We're interested in the potential of the fuel cell because of its 
promise of reduced maintenance and greater reliability compared to other 
systems."" 
	""In addition to the unattended applications for the Coast Guard, there are 
other potential remote power applications in operation around the world, such 
as pipeline monitoring, microwave relay stations, and numerous other

	?Mail this article to a friend 
	
	(This article was originally published Monday) 
	WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has limited 
authority to address flawed electricity markets in California and alleged 
price gouging by power producers, but will act to overhaul the state's 
wholesale power markets if necessary, FERC Chairman James Hoecker told a 
congressional panel Monday. 
	The commission was ready to act once the results of an expedited staff 
investigation of problems affecting power markets in the U.S. West becomes 
available, Hoecker said in testimony presented to a San Diego field hearing 
of the House Commerce Committee's energy panel. 
	""If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction, 
we will do so,"" Hoecker told lawmakers. And if price gouging is occurring ""as 
some have alleged,"" he added, ""we will respond accordingly, by revoking 
market-based rates or otherwise."" 
	However, Hoecker stressed that the commission's authority is limited under 
the Federal Power Act. 
	""The commission has limited ability to relieve the immediate customer crisis. 
Important aspects of this problem are a state responsibility, such as 
authorizing construction of new generation and transmission facilities,"" 
Hoecker testified. 
	The commission can't act to limit prices charged by power providers ""until we 
have a record supporting such action,"" he said, referring to the results of 
the pending staff investigation. 
	Further, he said, the law bars FERC from ordering retroactive refunds to San 
Diego Gas & Electric Co. for the power it purchased this summer to serve its 
retail customer base. 
	Hoecker testified before the House Commerce Committee's Energy and Power 
Subcommittee, which is looking into the supply shortages in California this 
summer that have forced San Diego electricity consumers to pay twice as much 
for power as they did a year ago. 
	State Mkt Structure Blamed For Crisis 
	The hearing comes after much wrangling at FERC, as SDG&E, a unit of Sempra 
Energy (SRE, news, msgs), sought an order setting price caps for power bid 
into the state-sponsored electricity exchange, and power producers sought an 
order allowing cost recovery for lost opportunity sales if the state's 
independent grid operator curtailed sales outside California, where price 
controls don't apply. 
	FERC hasn't yet responded to the producers, and deferred action on SDG&E's 
bid for price controls until the staff investigation is completed. But it 
left in place an order allowing the independent system operator to limit the 
price it pays for power, which acts as a de facto cap on prices bid into the 
power exchange. 
	Hoecker, while withholding judgment pending the staff probe, appeared to 
place much of the blame for this summer's crisis with the state-mandated 
market structure, which left San Diego consumers subject to spot-market 
volatility. 
	And he appeared to suggest that FERC's order directing utilities to transfer 
transmission assets to control of large regional transmission organizations, 
or RTOs, will offer an opportunity to develop a regional solution to the 
power-supply problem. 
	FERC deferred to California in restructuring the wholesale market in 
California because its experience with new market institutions such as power 
exchanges and ISOs was limited, Hoecker said. 
	Other states, such as Pennsylvania, were ""less prescriptive than California 
in telling the commission how their wholesale markets should operate,"" 
Hoecker noted. 
	Now, with FERC's Order 2000 encouraging formation of RTOs, ""the commission is 
in a very different posture with respect to the structure of wholesale 
markets,"" he said. 
	""Large regional markets can be made to work effectively,"" Hoecker told the 
lawmakers, citing the Pennsylvania restructuring as an example. 
	Other witnesses were more forceful in criticizing the state-mandated market 
structure. 
	By requiring the state's three investor-owned utilities to purchase all their 
electricity from the power exchange and limiting their ability to hedge price 
risks by entering into long-term fixed-price contracts, the state left 
consumers subject to volatility in the state-mandated spot market, said 
officials with Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) and Reliant Energy (REI, news, 
msgs). 
	California's market structure ""placed no economic incentives on the default 
utility providers to look out for the costs that are ultimately passed on to 
their consumers,"" Reliant's John Stout testified. 
	""San Diego's experience offers the Congress an unparalleled opportunity to 
learn from a bungled attempt at deregulation,"" said Michael Shames, executive 
director of Utility Consumer's Action Network. 
	Shames and other witnesses warned the congressional committee that 
California's electricity crisis is likely to occur in other regions of the 
country unless steps are taken to free up interstate trade in power and allow 
FERC to better police markets. 
	""California is just the latest problem area in U.S. power markets and, unless 
policymakers act quickly, it will not be the last,"" said Enron Corp. (ENE, 
news, msgs) Steven Kean executive vice president. 
	""Unless Congress and FERC are willing to address the interstate issues that 
are beyond the jurisdiction of state legislators and regulators, I predict 
that our experience in San Diego is indicative of what others will encounter 
in trying to create a competitive electricity market,"" said Edwin Guiles, 
Sempra's president of regulated operations. 
	""This electricity crisis is not a California-only problem,"" said Rep. Brian 
Bilbray, R-Calif., who represents San Diego and requested Monday's hearing. 
	""We will continue to be in this mess if state and federal officials don't 
work together to find long-term solutions to the flaws in the marketplace,"" 
Bilbray said.

Subject: MDEA Contract Revision Questions

Kay -- Just some housekeeping questions:

Do you want hand-written or e-mail comments going forward?

Do you want more comments from Origination and Services now, or do you want 
us to wait until you turn the doc?  As I said yesterday, I am in the process 
of sorting out the ""Costs"" definition so that it works better with the other 
parts of the doc.  

MDEA is willing to extend the ILA two weeks if we want to.  Their next Board 
meeting (after tonight's Board meeting) is June 12 , and they desperately 
need to have our contract finished in time to get signing approval at that 
meeting.  We probably need something to bridge us from the end of May until 
their Board votes on the full agreement.  The other option is to get done 
this week and have them call a special Board meeting.  They have done this in 
the past, but we have not asked them if it's logistically possible to do this 
by May 31.

Thanks -- David

My only warning is that working for Sheila is that she takes over most of the 
big stuff, even if it is your deal. Everything that she is working on now was 
one of her lawyers' deals, but ""things just weren't getting done"".  She can 
be very unclear in what she expects from you.  She is the ultimate 
micro-manager.  She may hire the outside counsel on ""your"" deal, then tell 
you about it later, not consulting you to find out who you want to use.   
This style may not bother you, as you may in fact get comfort from working 
closely with someone.  Clearly, she has a lot of experience to impart, and 
she is very, very nice.  

I'm sure there will be a downside to working with Jeff and Barbara, I just

Note in particular changes in exclusivity (now bilateral), tax abatement

covered by the confidentiality provisions, although this version is very

Here are the issues I see with their draft:

Does not allow for us to sell them power, only buy their power and sell to 
others. This means that we can't sell them power until we get the full 
contract in place.

Fuel transactions include fuel oil, and I thought we weren't managing fuel 
oil.

Incentive fee (in main contract) defined to only include the sale of gas.

Doesn't include the language we need for internal approvals.

Payment section doesn't address payment for sale of power to them from the 
market.

The LOC is in the works, and GE understands that 10% will be retained in

Hi there,

I made some revisions to the language Rose proposed.

Here are some questions/comments:

I deleted the references to changing any delegation of rights/obligations. =

I suggest we consider using a credit rating instead of ""substantially=20

Rose/Lisa, I've added some SPV language.

I'm added receipt of final payment as an exception to the credit rating=20
standard.  In other words, if they have received their final payment, they=
=20
can't use credit as a reason to not give consent.

I don't think we should agree to provide a list of power projects done by t=

Reagan,

I've requested the issuance of a draft master (gas) for Clarksdale.  Yazoo has theirs in hand, but I haven't heard any of any comments.

The power side is a bit more complicated.  Yazoo City and Clarksdale have not cut a deal between them to determine how to buy power - whether it should be bought  by MDEA (easier in some accounting respects, but credit is more of an issue) or by the individual Cities.  

Maybe this should be on the list for our 300 meeting.

Fuel cells kindle investor energy
By Beverly Goodman
Redherring.com, November 27, 2000 
Companies with no earnings. Market capitalizations in the billions even 
though revenue hovers in the tens of millions. Analyst optimism bordering on 
the feverish. We know -- this probably sounds all too familiar. But this time 
we're not talking about some pie-in-the-sky dot-com stock valuations. We're 
talking about companies with new technologies, tangible assets, and a clear 
source of future revenue. We're talking about makers of fuel cells, a highly 
efficient and environmentally sound means of generating electricity. 
And while we won't deny that the recent run-up in their stocks befits the 
pattern of investor enthusiasm for the latest fad, we at Red Herring expect 
that alternative energy will be in fashion for quite some time. Investors 
more interested in companies that sell dog food over the Internet can stop 
reading here.
There's no mystery why fuel cells are an appealing source of energy: they 
provide more reliable and efficient power with lower emissions and noise than 
traditional generating sources (see Trend No. 9: Energy, December 4). Most 
only require the simplest of gases and throw off only water and heat as 
by-products, both of which are reusable. Simply put, fuel cells consist of 
hydrogen and oxygen, separated by a catalyst. Typically, the fuel cell is 
heated, causing a chemical reaction that generates electricity. Since nothing 
is burned, no pollutants are created. In time, proponents say, fuel cells 
will power everything from your cell phone to your car to the factories that 
manufacture them.
During this era of greater environmental awareness and rising fuel prices, 
fuel cell technology is increasingly looking like an appealing investment. 
Stocks powered by fuel cell technology are up an average of 139 percent in 
the last 12 months. That's despite a slow recovery from the 40 percent hit 
they took in the spring. The Nasdaq, by comparison, has fallen 15 percent 
since last November.
Investor interest has also prompted a recent spate of IPOs. H Power (Nasdaq: 
HPOW), Millennium Cell (Nasdaq: MCEL), and Proton Energy Systems (Nasdaq: 
PRTN) all went public within the past few months. While those IPOs may seem 
to coincide neatly with the rising cost of fuel, that's not the whole 
picture. ""We're seeing a convergence of factors never seen before,"" says 
William Fogel, a power technology analyst for First Albany. ""The deregulation 
in the utility industry has increased innovation; the transportation grid is 
in jeopardy thanks to an increase in electrical demand from an Internet-based 
economy; there's a growing need for increased reliability; and there's an 
increasing recognition of the environmental degradation caused by the 
combustion engine.""
Admittedly, truly widespread applications remain more than a decade away, so 
profits are similarly distant for fuel cell companies. But investors have 
proven themselves willing to invest in technologies long before they become 
mainstream, buying stocks that often defy traditional valuations. (Still 
holding JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq: JDSU)?) With early-stage fuel cell technology 
due out of the labs and available to individual and corporate consumers 
within the year, this is still the early part of the adoption (and investing) 
curve.
CELL DIVISION
The fuel cell market is generally divided into four segments: stationary, 
portable, residential, and automotive. Fuel cells will likely hit the large 
stationary market first, powering strip malls and factories, according to 
David Redstone, editor of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Investor newsletter. 
""We're talking about unprecedented efficiency,"" he says, noting that fuel 
cells approach 60 percent efficiency (that is, 60 percent of the potential 
energy in fuel entering the cell actually results in energy coming out).
Fuel cells can also be coupled with turbines to get their efficiency up to 80 
percent, whereas traditional combustion engines only run at 35 percent 
efficiency. The leading developer of these stationary cells is Fuelcell 
Energy (Nasdaq: FCEL) (FCE), which is poised to be the first to commercialize 
them in 2001. At first blush, FCE's 442 percent run-up in the last 12 months 
and the fact that it won't be profitable until 2006 doesn't make its $59.50 
stock price and price/sales ratio of 58 seem cheap. But using a variety of 
metrics, including discounted cash flow, discounted 2006 net income, and 
discounted 2006 revenue, Lehman Brothers analyst Maureen Murphy considers FCE 
undervalued by 40 percent. Using a projected market value of five times 
estimated 2006 revenue of $1 billion, she applies a discount rate of 17.5 
percent annually to arrive at a 12-month price target of $124.
Portable applications for fuel cells, like generators and boat engines, are 
also expected to be commercialized soon. Ballard Power Systems (Nasdaq: BLDP
), with more than 370 patents issued or pending, has proven itself in nearly 
all fuel cell applications and has promised to bring a small fuel 
cell-powered generator to market in 2001. ""They don't make promises they're 
not able to keep,"" says Christine Farkas, a senior specialist and director at 
Merrill Lynch. ""They've never disappointed."" Ballard has also made 
significant strides in the automotive market and owns 27 percent of Xcellsis, 
a fuel cell engine maker that is a joint venture with DaimlerChrysler (NYSE: 
DCX) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F).
Analysts expect Ballard to continue to post losses until sometime in 2004, 
and its current price-to-sales ratio is a whopping 265. Still, Ballard's 
involvement in all aspects of fuel cell applications leads Ms. Farkas to 
expect the company to earn $24.22 per share by 2013 -- which works out to 
approximately $2.2 billion in net income. Applying a multiple of 25 to those 
earnings, and a 15 percent discount rate, she comes up with a projected stock 
price of $150 a year from today, or 93 percent above recent prices.
INDUSTRY REVOLUTION
Even though powering cars with fuel cells is still some years off, the notion 
has found allies in some unlikely industries -- the major oil and automotive 
sectors. Ford chairman William Clay Ford Jr. declared at the 2000 Detroit 
Auto Show, ""Longer term, the fuel cell will end the 100-year reign of the 
internal combustion engine."" Legislation such as California's mandate that by 
2003 fully 10 percent of cars sold (an estimated 22,000) must run on 
alternative energy will also help speed industry and public acceptance.
While not a pure-play on fuel cells, Impco Technologies is well positioned to 
see its fuel cell business grow along with its other alternative fuel 
delivery, storage, and power electronics systems. Mr. Fogel expects Impco's 
products to compete for 40 percent, or $5 billion of the forecasted $12.5 
billion automotive fuel cell market in 2010. (Its much more down-to-earth P/S 
ratio of 1.6 is an added attraction for investors -- any risk involved in 
Impco's fuel cell development is hedged by its full involvement in the 
alternative fuel industry.) ""They're involved with almost every aspect of 
General Motors's global alternative fuel production, design, and 
implementation efforts,"" Mr. Fogel says.
Impco was hit particularly hard this spring, and is still, at $18, 65 percent 
off its March 6 high of $52. But by using a 45 multiple on projected 2006 
earnings per share of $2.86 and applying a 20 percent discount, Mr. Fogel 
arrives at a price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio of less than one -- a 
conservative multiple for stocks with similar growth prospects. Mr. Fogel 
sees more than a 100 percent upside for the company's stock, expecting it to 
return to its high in the coming 12 months.
Despite the industry hype and science fiction scenarios, there will 
inevitably be setbacks. Take, for example, Plug Power (Nasdaq: PLUG), which 
ran out of gas when General Electric (NYSE: GE), which owns one-third of a 
joint venture with Detroit Edison (NYSE: DTA) and Plug, decided to change 
course. Plug's trailing 12-month revenue of $13 million (giving it a 
price-to-sales ratio of 64) hinged on the venture, in which a fuel cell 
powered a house, independent of the local electrical grid. Instead, GE now 
wants to develop a ""grid parallel"" system, which would work in tandem with 
the existing system. That news, coupled with management woes and Nasdaq 
turbulence, sent Plug's share price falling 80 percent, from $140 on March 13 
to $16.50 on November 24. It will take all the energy fuel cells can generate 
to get that stock back on track.

Lisa (Mellencamp) and Chuck are getting married, date unknown.  He has given 
up his apartment and has moved in.  That makes 6 teenage girls under one

Gentlemen,

I thought I would pull together a brief email outlining where we are on 
certain tasks.  Here goes:

Hub Agency Agreement - Gregg recently met with Peoples to discuss some of the 
outstanding commercial issues relating to the Hub Agency Agreement.  Roy is 
putting together a summary of the outcome of that meeting.  Gregg and I 
decided it would be better to not send Peoples the current draft of the 
agreement which has been circulated internally, but instead will send a draft 
which incorporates the outcome of these discussions.

Memo regarding restricted activities - David has prepared a draft for Enron's 
review.  Here's the draft:

Gregg and I need to review it.

Gregg and Peoples have been working on the grandfathered transaction list.  
Since both sides are running behind on this,  David prepared a very straight 
forward amenment to the LLC agreement, exending the time frame for finishing 
the task.  Here it is:
 

Policies - Gregg ""Policy Man"" Penman has been working on a credit policy, 
cash management policy, risk management policy, and probably a couple of 
others I'm forgetting.

Revolving line of credit - Gregg has been working the internal Enron system 
to get approval for a $50mm line of credit for MEH.  He has raised the issue 
of Peoples needing to provide a guarantee for their half.  Also, it may be 
necessary or advisable to document that the line of credit will be paid 
before any distributions are made to either member.  This is still under 
internal review at Enron.  I will check around to see if Corp (the lender) 
has a form of credit facility we should use.

Miscellaneous:
Decide about services agreement
Confidentiality agreements 
Transfer pricing documentation
Other agreements (ISDA, GISB, Peaking Agency, Third Party Master)
Board resolution appointing officers/managers
Budget and marketing plan 
Other administrative functions (per Gregg's Business Setup Items list)

Hope this is helpful.

Kay

Since the time frame is short, I wanted to give you an outline to mark 
up/correct.

Here's how I understand the deal:

People's has the Manlove gas storage facility.  We have presented to People's 
a nonphysical method to monetize it, similar to what was done with Bammel.  
Since this is a regulated asset, regulatory approval will be required, and 
the consumers will receive part of the benefit of the monetization.  The 
essence of our deal is that Enron will receive 50% of the net earnings, up to 
$25mm, as our fee.  In consideration for this fee, Enron takes the financial, 
legal, accounting and engineering lead. Peoples and Enron will work together 
on the regulatory strategy formulation and implementation.

We want to present a draft MOU to Peoples this week.  The basic goals are:

Define scope of the agreement
Define our lead role in the 4 stated areas
Create exclusivity for Enron 
Define financial arrangements (cost/profit)
Get an acknowledgement that what was presented to them was proprietary, and 
covered by our confidentiality agreement.
Define term (5 years) 

Each party bears their own internal costs, and third party costs are split 
50/50, with prior approval.  In that regard an immediate concern is getting 
the engineering work kicked off.  

We want the agreement broad enough to cover physical withdrawals.  We do not 
want it specific to this field, since we want the benefit of the use of our 
methodology.

Please correct/supplement, etc.  

Thanks,

Kay",enron_mail/maildir/mann-k/all_documents/758,10,2,21,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,248,14,37,36,31,4.733870967741935,29,320,1494,99,148,10

Hi guys,

Here are some quick thoughts:

2.10  Suggest we delete ""specific"" from second line.  
3.3  (i)To protect cash flow neutral status we need to get the money a couple 
of business days before date due.
6.2  We need to discuss changes which could materially impact the value of 
the agreement to MEH, not just the risks/responsibilities.

I'd bracket the concept of what the Admin Service Fee is supposed to cover.  
Can we recover any additional costs, such as the cost of preparing/filing 
docs on their behalf (2.2) and collection (3.1)?  I think we probably need to 
limit our role to ""short of litigation"" type stuff.   Maybe ""reasonable 
efforts, short of litigation"", something like that?

That's all for the first quick read.

Subject: Agency Agreement


As we discussed, in an effort to forward our internal discussions and 
memorialize the results of our discussions in Chicago last week, Boyd and I 
have produced a new draft of the Agency Agreement.  The changes can be 
inspected by launching the attachment in Word and then going to Tools --- 
Track Changes --- Highlight Changes to display and print the changes in the 
document.

A number of questions must be addressed.  They include, in no particular 
order:

Can we delete the confidentiality article?

Is it commercially important to restore the langauge on displacement 
deliveries?

What will the compensation arrangements be?

Are we willing to deduct the administrative fee from the net cumulative 
revenues?  [Doing so ""loses"" us $10,000 a month.]

Will we collect accounts receivable directly or have payments made to a 
deposit account in which we will retain a security interest?

How should Section 2.9(ii) be recast to allay Boyd's regulatory approval 
concern?

Is the new Section 2.10 acceptable?

How must the agreement change to reflect the ""two county"" concern?

I look forward to discussing this with you at your convenience.  DT

Subject: Vitro consolidation agreement

Team Vitro:

I wanted to run these changes by you before sending them to Jeff Smith.

Jeff S. has lobbied for deleting the language on assignment, and state that 
assignment of the consolidation agreement will be subject to the same terms, 
etc. as the other 2 contracts.  He also provide alternative language which 
appears to be close to what was in the previous draft. Since I didn't know 
the genesis of the language in the consolidation agreement, so I thought I 
would check with you first.

I eliminated 5 (a) because the contracts allow for partial termination.

(Paul Parrish) is OK with the 100% coverage.  The original deal was that they 
would be off the hook for cosmetic damage incurred by GE's storage, so to put

This seminar that Ric is going to in Las Vegas is having cocktail receptions 
each evening and special shows by Dana Carvey and Penn and Teller.  There's 
no dress specified, so I'm assuming something nice but not overdone.  What 
would you think?

I just knew you guys got rain the entire weekend.  I'm glad it worked out 
ok.  I tried calling last night but got a busy signal. 

When Michael's school asked for names/addresses of grandparents, I didn't 
know they were going to send a request for $.  Sorry about that!

We are trying to figure out Paige's plans for Thanksgiving, although I'm 
about to give up on figuring it out. She doesn't know if she can get a ticket 
to the game yet. I'm kinda in the mood to cook, but that's as far as we've 
gotten.  Lisa tells me they may be heading your way on Saturday?  We'll 
probably figure things out in the next few days.

We are waiting to see if I'm going to be in town on Thursday to make plans.  
I haven't been out of town since our anniversary, so it must be time to go 
again!  Generally speaking Neil gets home around 600.

Hope you are enjoying the pretty weather today.  I can sure see along way 
today.

Good morning. We hope you did not get washed or blown away yesterday. Would
you believe it didn't rain here until last night. We got an inch of rain
then. It did rain a slow drizzle most of the day Saturday. Every thing
worked out great with our company. They fished Friday and we went to Port
Lavaca and Victoria Saturday to some Arts and Craft shows. They could fish
again after we got home. Bobby Clarke's dad is to have the proceduce that
sends dye through the arteries around his heart this morning. He has been
having chest pains. Sallie's mother has had her arteries in her neck
checked out also. Mary's were clear. She is doing fine. I forgot to tell
you we sent money to Michael's school. They will put his name plate in it.
So of course we sent Paige some money also. Do you know your Thanksgiving
plans yet?  I must stop so you can go back to work. Let us know a good time
to call Neil on his birthday. Our Love,Mother

meets with Bingham to get work assignments started (i.e., permitting work, 
start drafting construction agreement, changes to Development

October 16, 2000--Meet with FuelCells in Bingham's offices.  Continue 
negotiations on P.O.

October 17-19, 2000--To be determined based on progress of meetings.  If need 
be, we could continue negotiations in Houston or have Kay patch in by the

Ben has asked me to prepare a draft Bill of Sale - Equipment schedule to 
support the closing of the Intergen transaction.

for the two LM6000 turbines and the one ABB transformer:

 Unit Description (Column A)
 Unit Number (Column B)
 Unit Serial # (Column C)
 Unit Delivery Date (Column D)
 Physical location of the units as of the date of schedule (1/5/01) (Column E)
 The equipment and all rights provided to Buyer under Agreement dated ____ 
(Column F)

I have filled in descriptions for each piece of equipment (Column A).  I need 
help with the following:

Chris:  Please fill in Columns B, C, D & E with current information from our 
equipment contracts.

Rebecca:  Please obtain the information for Columns A, B, C, D, E, & F  from 
Catherine in Global Finance.  This should be the information that was 
recorded in the TurboPark financing documents when the equipment option 
agreements were moved into TurboPark from West LB.

Kay:  Please fill in the dates for Column F and let me know if any additional 
information is required to complete this schedule.

Please forward me a revised copy of this spreadsheet once you have completed 
the relevant information.  I welcome your input on the information contained 
within this schedule.

Our goal here is to create a schedule which is factually correct (based on 
all of the relevant agreements) and does not create any 
inconsistencies/conflicts with the TurboPark documents.  We need to deliver a 
draft of this schedule to the TurboPark banks tomorrow  for their review.  
This schedule represents one of four documents required to effect a smooth 
transfer of the relevant equipment interests from TurboPark into the 
respective CA Development entity and close this transaction prior to the 
1/15/01 deadline.

Call me to discuss any of this information.

Subject: Warranty Claims

Kay -

As part of the contract implementation, we need to authorize the plant 
managers at Gleason and Wheatland to execute warranty issues with 
Westinghouse.  I've taken a first stab.  Please review from a legal 
perspective and change as necessary.  Note that there are 3 total contracts, 
two for Gleason and one for Wheatland.

Gavin, please provide contact names and addresses to Kay for the Westinghouse 
section.  Please also provide the contract numbers.

Pete & Chris, my intention is to empower you to be able to talk directly with 
SW on warranty issues.  Obviously, the terms of the O&M contract and common 
sense should dictate when you cut in the owner (me). Additionally, OEC's 
internal procedures and methods will dictate when you cut in your chain of 
command.  Performance test issues, MW limiter issues, etc will be coordinated 
by Houston since they involve deeper commercial issues.

Thanks,

Mitch

Peter, 

I can't recall if I've sent you this override letter before.  Essentially, it 
is a letter which is in effect for as long as the equipment is owned by 
E-Next Generation, but which ceases to be effective once the equipment is 
assigned to a third party.   We will need something along the same line for 
the ABB equipment.  If you can send me a redline of the final form of the 
ABB  facility agreement against the master, we can discuss how to proceed.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi there,

I made some revisions to the language Rose proposed.

Here are some questions/comments:

I deleted the references to changing any delegation of rights/obligations. =
=20
I'm not yet clear as to what the agency language will look like, and what=
=20
rights we need/want to change (i) the identity of the agent (ii) the role o=
f=20
the agent (iii) whether the agency can be terminated.  I'm just not that=20
familiar with the structure yet, but if I can get that information, I'll wo=
rk=20

I suggest we consider using a credit rating instead of ""substantially=20
similiar"" comparison.  Just easier to decipher.

Rose/Lisa, I've added some SPV language.

I'm added receipt of final payment as an exception to the credit rating=20
standard.  In other words, if they have received their final payment, they=
=20
can't use credit as a reason to not give consent.

I don't think we should agree to provide a list of power projects done by t=
he=20
assignee in the past 5 years.  I also think 3 years is a bit much on audite=
d=20
financials, but I didn't comment there.

I don't like their language that an affiliate must be intending to=20
own/operate the plant.  I've just bracketed the langauge and added=20
""construct"", since I don't know if this point has already been agreed.

Enough explanation, here it is (with Word file attached below):

everyone just loves Michael. He is so sweet.  He is staying with my folks 
this week, and the 3 of us miss him so badly.  I can't wait for him to come 
home.  Neil is going to meet my folks and Michael in Palacios this Friday, 
and spend the weekend there, bringing him home on Sunday.  I've got to take 
Roscoe for his last mange shot, so I'm staying.  Plus, I spent last weekend 
with my folks, and too much exposure doesn't work for us.  I hope to  PURGE 
the house of all the junk I have.  I hope it is raining, because  that is 
great cleaning weather.  I want to see bare space in my closet.  I think I'll 
call the Women's Center and see what type of stuff they need.

I'm planning on taking next Thursday and Friday off.  Next Thursday is 
Paige's 21st birthday, so we have great plans.  Do you know anywhere that can 
enlarge a photo and mount it on a board?

I still get a bill for the card they used previously for my phone.  Go figure.

The problem is that the two pictures are so dramatically different from each

very respectable, likeable, and professional, whereas #2 looks  very 
professional, likeable, and respectable.   Real hard call, but I think you go 
with #1. 

Besides, the exposure and contrast on #1  looks better - its darker. I have

Either email or handwritten works for me.  I would just as soon have 
everything now, if it is possible to get it to me in the today or tomorrow.

In discussing the extension yesterday, the consensus was that we should 
extend until June 29th.  If the deal gets done sooner, we can always have the 
new doc supercede the old one.  I'm copying Heather and Reagan so that they 
can  let me know if I've got it wrong.

Subject: MDEA Contract Revision Questions

Kay -- Just some housekeeping questions:

Do you want hand-written or e-mail comments going forward?

Do you want more comments from Origination and Services now, or do you want 
us to wait until you turn the doc?  As I said yesterday, I am in the process 
of sorting out the ""Costs"" definition so that it works better with the other 
parts of the doc.  

MDEA is willing to extend the ILA two weeks if we want to.  Their next Board 
meeting (after tonight's Board meeting) is June 12 , and they desperately 
need to have our contract finished in time to get signing approval at that 
meeting.  We probably need something to bridge us from the end of May until 
their Board votes on the full agreement.  The other option is to get done 
this week and have them call a special Board meeting.  They have done this in 
the past, but we have not asked them if it's logistically possible to do this 
by May 31.

Thanks -- David

Subject: Peoples Letter Agreement

Kay - Here is my attempt to turn the term sheet into something executable.  I 
have accepted all of William Harmon's changes except for the second paragraph 
under amended terms.  William used the wording ""The payment late payment 
amount is calculated..."".  I changed it to ""The payment interest on overdue 
amounts is calculated..."" to be consistent with the reference in the above 
paragraph.  I don't think this changes any substance, but I defer to you.  I 
think that is all I changed.  I also added a quick intro. and a paragraph on 
future payments to reiterate this is only for October purchases.  Neither may 
be necessary, let me know.  I am not sure your availability tomorrow, but I 
would love to hear from you ASAP in the morning to get this in front of 
Peoples for signature.  Russell Diamond is coordinating the internal Enron 
approvals with Global Finance, Credit and RAC.

Thanks again for your help on your vacation day.

We have decided to use:  Voyager Development Company, L.L.C. for the new 
Homestead land option.  We had initially planned to use it for an option that 
we let go (Option Agreement never got assigned to Voyager either).  According

Subject: Proposal to Siemens Westinghouse

Kay and Ben,

Per my conversation with Ben, I have revised the offer to now read:

Lynn ,

In an effort to expeditiously resolve our issues regarding the damaged 
generator, we suggest the following offer, subject to ENA Management approval 
and the execution of the appropriate documents:

Enron will pay Siemens Westinghouse $1,500,000 towards the cost of the 
Replacement Generator.
Enron and Siemens Westinghouse agree to split the proceeds of the insurance 
claim on a 50/50 basis up to the point where Enron has recouped their 
$1,500.000 payment
Any insurance proceeds recovered in excess of $3,000,000 ($1,500,000 to 
Enron, $ 1,500,000 to Siemens Westinghouse) are to Siemens Westinghouse 
account.
By Siemens Westinghouse acceptance of this offer, Enron waives its claim to 
Delivery Liquidated Damages


Example:

Enron Payment to Siemens Westinghouse:   $1,500,000

Insurance Proceeds from Damaged Generator   $4,000,000     
 Enron's share of insurance proceeds:   $1,500,000  =($4,000,000 x 0.5) up to 
$1,500,000
 Siemens Westinghouse's share of insurance proceeds: $2,500,000  = 
($4,000,000 - $1,500,000)


This suggestion is for settlement purposes only, and is without prejudice to 
any rights or positions of Enron or Siemens Westinghouse.

We expect to have a change order executed by ABB on Monday (Tuesday at the 
latest) whereby we agree to pay all but the retainage amount, and they 
acknowledge that we can assign it to WHOEVER, including the agent (right?).

Ben and I discussed the fact that the Coral turbines will be moved into 
TurboPark.  I believe we will want to assign the turbines to an Enron LLC the 
following week. FYI, we have a conference call tomorrow to finish the binding 
agreement to see them the turbines.  If it would work to keep them in WestLB, 
that's great. However, I want to do whatever creates the least amount of 
stress for you two.  I'll manage Coral and Ben.  Please advise.

Mark,

I've reviewed the fax sent yesterday with the Proposed Conditions to Special 
Use for Livingston Energy Center.  Is Titan Land Development the Owner?  Will 
it be necessary for Titan to make the escrow payment prior to exercising the 
relevant land options and the commencement of construction?

I do not know whether these agreements and/or the making of the deposit would 
impact the balance sheet treatment, but I understand from Fred that we are 
not concerned about the balance sheet treatment for this project.

Subject: Livingston County Approval Issues - ISSUES FOR TODAY

As you know we are scheduled to appear before the Livingston County Zoning
Board of Appeals (""ZBA"") tomorrow evening for initial approval of the
Livingston Energy Center (the ""Facility"").  Assuming, we receive a vote to
approve the Facility, the ZBA will be approving the Conditions of Approval
of the Special Use sent out yesterday for everyone's final approval and
sign-off.   Please note that we have incorporated into these conditions the
stormwater management conditions, township and county highway roadway
conditions, and other matters. If there are any changes or modifications to
these conditions, our ability to incorporate may be limited if they are not
received by 4pm today.  Of course, if necessary, we will attempt to make
modifications after that time.  

It is possible based on on-going negotiations with the County and our
neighbors that additional changes may be required today or tomorrow.  We
will of course contact you immediately if that occurs.  If you have any
questions, please do not hesitate to call or email Karen or me.  Thanks.

Hi again.

Here is the consent to assignment which I believe is ready to go.  The only 
changes I made was adding the requirement to give notice of the financing in 
3 (f), and making the release of WestLB specific to these turbines (1(b)).  

I will bring signature pages tomorrow, and will forward the override letter

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Each project must have its own break out contract - that's the deal struck 
with GE and with the lenders.  There will be no change orders to the master 
contract relating to specific projects.  The break out contract must be 
entered into ""as soon as practicable"". This appproach has been taken with 
Austin, LV Co Gen, and ESA, and all of those contracts are just about 
finished.

Gentlemen,

I thought I would pull together a brief email outlining where we are on 
certain tasks.  Here goes:

Hub Agency Agreement - Gregg recently met with Peoples to discuss some of the 
outstanding commercial issues relating to the Hub Agency Agreement.  Roy is 
putting together a summary of the outcome of that meeting.  Gregg and I 
decided it would be better to not send Peoples the current draft of the 
agreement which has been circulated internally, but instead will send a draft 
which incorporates the outcome of these discussions.

Memo regarding restricted activities - David has prepared a draft for Enron's 
review.  Here's the draft:

Gregg and I need to review it.

Gregg and Peoples have been working on the grandfathered transaction list.  
Since both sides are running behind on this,  David prepared a very straight 
forward amenment to the LLC agreement, exending the time frame for finishing 
the task.  Here it is:
 

Policies - Gregg ""Policy Man"" Penman has been working on a credit policy, 
cash management policy, risk management policy, and probably a couple of 
others I'm forgetting.

Revolving line of credit - Gregg has been working the internal Enron system 
to get approval for a $50mm line of credit for MEH.  He has raised the issue 
of Peoples needing to provide a guarantee for their half.  Also, it may be 
necessary or advisable to document that the line of credit will be paid 
before any distributions are made to either member.  This is still under 
internal review at Enron.  I will check around to see if Corp (the lender) 
has a form of credit facility we should use.

Miscellaneous:
Decide about services agreement
Confidentiality agreements 
Transfer pricing documentation
Other agreements (ISDA, GISB, Peaking Agency, Third Party Master)
Board resolution appointing officers/managers
Budget and marketing plan 
Other administrative functions (per Gregg's Business Setup Items list)

Hope this is helpful.

12/3.  All other lists sent to you by various people this week can be 
ignored.  If a counterpartys says ""declined"" by Credit, you don't need to 
look at it.  If there is nothing in the box it means ""approved"" and, as of 
today, look at ""divisions"" which means they are trading out of a division

counterparty issues from the physical trading groups, most of the 
counterparty issues will be with the financial trading counterparties.  I 
ONLY NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A COUNTERPARTY.

Most of the physical trading group's issues will revolve around which 
contract to use, and that should be resolved directly with Global Contracts, 
in the same way you resolve such issues on an ""off-line"" basis.

Samantha,
Tana,

I have attached an amended credit worksheet for the referenced counterparty.  
This amended worksheet includes a Guaranty from its parent company of $5MM, 
thus increasing the collateral threshold to $5MM, and amending other credit 
covenants.

Per the Legal Comment in the Master Swap Lotus Notes Database, Tana received 
a call from the counterparty requesting a 'less complicated' agreement.  In 
the comment, Tana suggested using an Industrial Master, if this agreement is 
OK from a Legal standpoint, I am OK using the Industrial from a Credit 
standpoint.  

Please draft this amended credit worksheet to an amended Industrial Master.  

Thank you,

The date our annual exemption expires in approval letter the NYMEX sends us 
when they approve our exemptions.  Because we have so many commodities we are 
applying for now, and the form is quite lengthy, it took the NYMEX quite a 
while last year to approve our requests, which moved the date back to July 26 
(last year our renewals were due the 1st week of July).  So we've got a lttle 
more time to work on it.  I will probably start notifying the various group's 
that provide information for the exemptions request sometime around the

can only do it immediately.  Do you want me to change it, or, Stephanie, 
since you've already changed it will it be already changed tomorrow so we

1.  Per my discussion last week with David Minns, I sent him a spreadsheet so 
he could scroll across the product list and see the full range of products 
EnronOnline offers so he could determine whether an Australian based 
counterparty will have any legal problems entering into any of the 
EnronOnline products.  It was my understanding that he had not seen a 
comprehensive list off all the products we offer.

2.  However, on a going forward basis, David Minns or someone in Legal will 
need to see the daily spreadsheets reflecting any new Australian based 
counterparties because every new counterparty requesting a password needs a 
Credit and a Legal signoff for trading every products we offer, whether 
physical, financial, power, gas, liquids, weather, p&p, US, European or other 
country based product, etc..  Houston Legal does it every day for every new 
Houston Credit based counterparty, London Legal does it every day for every

I'm afraid I'm still none the wiser . Anyway , points of history : (1) Yes , 
we did , technically , lose the American War of Independence but it was 
because we got sick of it and had other ""fish to fry"" in Asia and Africa , 
plus it was really a civil war because the people who ""beat"" us were , 
largely , first or second generation ""Americans"" and , therefore ,  Brits 
(for example , George Washington's family home is still there close to my 
home town of Sunderland in North-East England ) and (2) we never lost to the 
French , we agreed to give them the worst bit - Quebec - in return for some 
tastier possessions elsewhere .

That fact that you asked ""who?"" begs the further question of what exactly you 
were up to in Houston.  Have the Brits ever really won a battle any way?  
(Their failure to beat a bunch of colonized farmers with pitch forks has 
resulted directly in this Florida mess, and their failure to put away the 
French (of all people) has resulted directly in me and the vast majority of 
my fellow Canadians being subjected to official and legally mandated 
bilingualism).

To the point, I believe San Felipe is the battle field adjacent to the 
Westheimer battle field, where the Brits (or at least one of them) were 
purportedly waging a more efficient war, until being caught red handed on the 
battle fields of San Felipe, where, all the while, the Canadian forces (or at 
least one of them) were so successfully conquering the enemy.

Peter.

Subject: Nice VP and possibly Pres.

When I look at Al Gore I continue to be amazed that one, let alone 50 
million, Americans voted for him.  Both Clinton's and Gore's continued 
shamelessness, and disregard for doing the right and decent thing, is only 
slightly less amazing than the American people (or at least half of them) 
continuing to find reasons to support them.  My only, yet substantive, vested 
interest in the outcome is that we are inundated with US T.V. and I can't 
bear the thought of looking at Gore (and God forbid Hillary) for the next 
four years.  If they don't settle this Florida thing, I am going to have it 
have my cable disconnected.

We vote in our federal election on November 27th.  We will not have any such 
problems however - not because we are any better than anyone (in fact, I am 
not entirely confident that most of my fellow Canadians will understand, or 
have ever have understood, the ballot or voted for who they thought they were 
voting for) - but rather because of the political system which Jon's 
ancestors were so kind to bestow upon us, which I refer to as ""parliamentary 
dictatorship''. 

(Sorry Tana if you are a Democrat, but that is the independent middle of the 
road - yeah right - view of a Canadian observer.  Jon, I cannot, however, 
apologize for the political ruin which your system of Government has brought 
upon us, other to acknowledge that the problem my not be the system but 
rather our screwed up regionalization of your unified parliamentary system 
into 11 separate parliamentary systems - and I suppose that could be 
construed as an apology of sorts, except, for the record, I will never 
apologize to you for anything until you make a public, i.e. to Tana and me by 
e-mail, confession of your sins on San Felipe.  For that matter, you are as 
bad as Clinton and Gore.)

Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is 
the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating 
EnronOnline mistake or ""oops"" trades.  The trades should continue to be 
initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any 
unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual 
circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk 
for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.  These same 
procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.

Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer 
and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.  The Termination 
Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.

The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be 
terminated.  Reverse trades should not be entered into.

If you have any questions, please call.

would need to talk to them about their authorizing statutes, legislative

As a general matter, you need to use the forms of Confidentiality Agreements

developed a few of our own forms for special purposes, one, which is in the 
swap forms database/current forms, protects the counterparty only, and is 
used when Credit wants to get copies of financal statements from a 
counterparty and protects the financial information being provided by the 
counterparty.

I have developed forms for use by the EnronOnline team, but those should not 
be used for any Enron company except EnronOnline and Enron Net Works.

For any other types of matters/projects, we would also use the forms

It was good to hear from you!

We had a nice Thanksgiving here too.  It's funny, because usually it's just 
me, Mom, Craig and Danelia, and Danelia doesn't really like roasted turkey or 
roast beef (not that she would say it to me!), so there is not just the same 
joy in cooking it would be elsewise.

It was good having the girls down.  We played a new version of Uno called 
""African Uno"" that was complex, fast and at times, physically challenging.  
It's not for the meek.  It was incredible what a good player Alena was.  She 
had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses (when you play you'll see 
why you can know everyone elses hands!).

I expect Craig didn't want Mom to see his place because it was messy.  I 
think compared to my house, he's embarrased about his apartment.  Then, also, 
he's got so much stuff in there right now, that I don't know how he's going 
to fit baby stuff.  They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed 
his lease last month because they don't want 3 people in that small 
apartment.  So he's going to have to start looking for another place.  And 
his apartment is so run down down I'm afraid roaches might be crawling over 
the baby.

I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the 
new baby.  You'll have to come visit to check out my new house.  The upstairs 
""guest suite"" is pretty neat.  It's got its own bathroom and tv, and is 
pretty cozy.

As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes, if he was thrilled to hear from me I 
couldn't tell by his voice.  It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of 
us.  But, I guess, it's a start...

I've already made my XMAS plans.  I leave the evening of the 21st, my flight 
comes in about 10 pm, and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am.  

It's good chatting with you.  Keep in touch!

Chris and Ben did a marvelous job for Thanksgiving, I can testify that it was
one of the best Thanksgiv8ing Dinners I've ever had (I not gonna tell them

well
as C & D.  I think she likes her special room in your house.

Tana,

Laurel Adams provided me your name to help us with the information regarding 
the legal contracts we are needing.  I am forwarding you the request that was 
originally sent to Laurel.  At this time, we would like to review the 
contracts that are listed below as part of our deal test.  As we need to 
complete our testing by Friday the 15th, we would like to review these 
contracts sometime today or tomorrow.  I apologize for the short notice; 
however, we received your name as the contact person yesterday.   Please let 
me know if can help us with this request.  If you have any questions or need 
additional information, please contact me at 3-1951.

Thank you, 

Carrie Richardson


Laurel,

We have been unsuccessful in getting the contract numbers in order to pull 
the contracts for the deals in our deal test.  We have talked with Bridgette 
Anderson and Anthony Campos in Global Contracts to obtain these numbers; 
however, we have had some difficulty.  What we are needing is the ISDA Master 
Agreement, not the system printout, for the dates listed for the following 
deals.

Master that we received lists the status as          draft with no effective 
date.  Please provide us with an executed agreement for this deal.

In order to wrap up our testing, please provide us with the above information

You crack me up!  Your baby report made me laugh!  Keep me posted on how the 
kids are doing.  I enjoy your stories.

All my home improvements are about done.  I've finally put in central air, 
repainted the interior, exterior, redone the hardwoods and landscaped, 
including a fountain in the backyard.  It looks like a new house!  The final 
job will be new carpets and window treatments when I can get around to it.  
I've been doing this for a year, and as you well know, it gets old living in 
a construction site.

I don't know if this is the final battle with the squirrels, or if we'll be 
at it again for another winter.  I thought I had most of their holes for 
getting in closed, but with all this new construction (the central air & 
heaters in my attics, with various lines coming out of the attic), I'll 
probably have to go through it again this winter.  I vow to prevail!

is for employees of Credit, who can then enter Credit comments.  Do you see 
that choice?  Is there some way for me to verify which employees of Legal and 
which employees of Credit have what access?  I know that some employees of 
Credit have Legal access by mistake.  Can I get lists of the Legal and Credit 
breakdowns?

As we discussed, attached is my ""Cheat Sheet"" which I use to guide me when 
approving non-US counterparties that come in through EnronOnline via Houston 
Credit.  London Legal and I try to coordinate our responses but I cannot 
speak for them and the standards they may apply to approving counterparties 
to trade online.  They also frequently deal with different countries than 
us.  You may want to speak to Justin Boyd.  Generally, with respect to most 
physical trading, except power trading, there are no legal restrictions to 
trading.  Most of the restrictions in this list are with respect to financial 
products.  Physical bandwidth has generally not done much legal due diligence 
outside of the US and the UK and bandwidth is therefore not open to non US 
and UK counterparties.

With physical power, generally, in most countries they require some sort of 
power marketing license so I look to the power lawyers to guide me.

As I also mentioned, for Japan or Australian based counterparties I wait for 
David Minns or Jane McBride to advise me.

David,

Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted 
into our Financial Trading Database.  This databse is the central master 
database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft 
form or that have been executed.  London currently updates this database to 
manage  its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the 
Australian agreements plugged into the system.

This database serves a number of purposes.  First, it is our core memory of 
contract negotiations.  Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take 
a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with 
and what negotiation issues may be at issue.  It is critical as we become a 
global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take 
on these financial contracts.  For instance, it would be quite problematic if 
someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and 
asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in 
another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the 
same position the day before.  We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort 
on the counterparty front.

In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no 
way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database.

Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside 
auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries.

For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master 
agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place. 
Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract 
records and approval for online trading.

For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our 
Clients, whether traders or  back office support people.  Employees outside 
legal have  limited view access only to see all the information except the 
confidential Legal and Credit comments.  They have no edit capabilities.  The 
database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have 
found helpful.

You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves, out database coordinator 
requesting full edit access for you.  It usually takes a few days.  Once you 
get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database, and we can 
figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted..

Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October?  That would be a good 
time for me to do a full review of this database with you.  ",enron_mail/maildir/jones-t/sent/1701,2,4,33,4,0,0,1,1,1,1,435,22,46,62,45,4.740229885057471,34,526,2588,196,226,0

We have three areas currently reserved for our bidders, what we will call Teams A, B & C.  The room situation is as follows:

              Satellite Breakout Rooms, 2992 & 2993 
              
	There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supplies or office supplies

Team B:  Main Conference Room 32c2
               Satellite Breakout Rooms 3260 and Conference Room (unmarked) to the left thereof 

             Currently no working phones in this area.  There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supllies or office supplies

Team C:  Main Conference Room 3371 = has working phone.
              Satellite Breakout Room 3376 = no working phone.

                         Has coffee thermos's & some coffee cups & supplies, needs office supplies.


           I just met at noon with Lance Jameson who handles, phones, faxes & furniture (x54423) and he is working on getting us phones, a fax machine, a non-network printer, and at least one laptop computer portal in each Team area.  After looking at the areas,  Lance thought the easiest Team area to have completed FIRST would be the 29th floor area (it seems to have the right computer/phone jacks) WHICH HE WILL TRY TO GET COMPLETED BY THE END OF TODAY.  SECOND, we will target the 32nd floor.

We have a fourth area available after this for Team D:  a suite of smaller offices/conference rooms also located on 29, in 2945, 2946, 2947, and around the corner in 2940.  2946, a smaller office has a workable phone there, Lance. We would need other phones installed there as well other the other equipment.

I had a conversation with Mark Taylor this morning about your board 
resolution.  He looked at the resolution we drafted for ECT International, 
and he said it would also cover the Singapore trading, so I have drafted a 
Secretary's Certificate and Incumbency Certificate for you to use.  With none 
of the Secretary's being located in Singapore, do you need my assistance in 
getting it signed here?  Who will you have sign the agreement?  What do you 
usually do?

no counterparty originating from U.S. Credit) should be approved to trade

Previously, the only Japanese financial product we had was weather, but it

that I didn't have any particular restrictions under Japanese law for 
counterparties located in or outside Japan in trading this product.  Now that 
the product is being sold by a Japan based company I am wondering was 
restrictions I might have to keep in mind when doing my daily online

2. Certificate of Secretary

3. Unanimous Consent of Directors (this is incomplete cos I am not sure of

As you may or may not be aware of, tomorrow is the drop dead date for 
approval of the referenced new product for our existing approved counterparty 
list.  Thinking through this product today and reading through my various 
emails from David Minns, I have come to the conclusion that there are no 
particular issues specifically relating to Australian financial power, and my 
thinking is to just mirror the approval for some other previously approved 
financial power product.  I can't, obviously, speak for you, but it seems to 
me that that should work for your counterparty lists too.  What do you think?

Per my conversation with Peter earlier today, below is a list of classes that 
Mark may want to coordinate his Houston secondment with so he can attend 
some. 

Internal Classes:

Basics of Risk Management:  4/26 - 4/27  filling up-act quickly

Derivatives 1:  4/17 - 4/18  filling up-act quickly
                             5/8 - 5/9 - lots of room still here

The internal classes book up quickly.  Everything between now and April is 
already full with large waiting lists.  If he is really interested he should 
try and sign up for classes immediately.  He can do that by going to the 
""Development Center"" Icon (aka ""Ernie"").  Then he can sign up on the computer.

External NYMEX Class:

I checked with the local NYMEX office, and their next classes are as follows:

June 7 - Introduction to NYMEX Products
June 14 - Intermediate Hedging (intro class a prerequisite)
June 17 - Intermediate Options (intro class a prerequisite)

Like the internal classes, the NYMEX classes also fill quickly.  Their 
February classes are already full.

As I also mentioned, the first weekend in April is when the Roundtop Antiques 
Festival is.  It is a great way to see the countryside outside of Houston, 
all the local towns around Roundtop also have antique festivals at that 
time.  The wildflowers should be in bloom, and that is alway impressive.  
With the cold weather and rain, we might have a really good year for 
wildflowers this year.

Hi Mark and Tana,

I called the Dept. of the interior and was subsequently given the number to 
the Director's office.  I was told that anyone there could help me. and I 
asked the woman who answered the phone what the legal name is.  She stated 
that the legal name is Minerals Management Service.  I asked if U.S. Dept. of 
Interior should be included as part of the legal name.  She said that it 
should appear as follows:

       U.S. Department of the Interior 
       Minerals Management Service

I'm about to make the correction in Global Counterparty.   Do you have any 
objection to putting a comma between them, because we do not have 2 lines to 
set it up in GCP as written above?

Per the directions of Sam Schott, I am forwarding this email on to you.  I 
discussed the counterparty name ""Minerals Management Service"" with my boss, 
Mark Taylor, General Counsel of ENA, and he agreed that agencies and 
departments of the US government should have the correct governmental 
agency/department as part of the counterparty name.  You could say ""Minerals 
Management Service"" is a dba for the US Department of the Interior.  We 
generally do not like to contract with dbas, we want the legal entity as part 
of the name.  A more appropriate name for this counterparty is ""US Department 
of the Interior Minerals Management Service"".  The way the exposure rolls up 
under the GCP System is an exposure issue, not a contract issue.  If you 
disagree with this assessment, please call Mark Taylor at x37459. ",enron_mail/maildir/jones-t/sent/5746,9,4,32,4,0,1,1,1,0,0,357,20,49,175,83,4.352941176470588,34,479,2033,128,179,35

Sara Shackleton, an attorney in our group, is drafting some language that we 
will be proposing to Deutsche Bank in response to their request that we add 
the Enron companies they do financial business with to the definition of 
""Specified Entity"".   We have some concern that by adding certain Enron 
entities to Specified Entity, a default in a swap transaction could possibly 
default certain structured loan transactions with a swap component, and we 
are trying to carve those transactions out.  

Sara is also working on the FUNB agreement.  I checked with her and the FUNB 
agreement we had been working from was so old that we agreed to start from 
the latest form of our agreement, so Sara sent Dee Travella at FUNB a revised 
draft on 11/8/00.  Sara's direct phone no. is 713/853-5620.

Effective 6/4/99, Bankers Trust Company was acquired by Deutsche Bank AG.  
All financial trading should now be transacted under the above Deutsche Bank

3.  Stay on Bissonnet for about 1/2 mile.  On the right you will see a gray

""Ashby"", make a right on Ashby.
4.  The first left is Wroxton Court.  I am in the upstairs of the duplex at

She was on long term leave for about 4 mos. and then has to reapply to get 
another job someone in Enron since her job was filled in our group.  I heard

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for January.  
To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable Macros 
and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Feb 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

3. The project is for posting EOL prices on NatSources Electronic Trading 
Platform.
4. The companys address is

140 Broadway
30th Floor, New York
NY 10005
It should be sent to the attention of Jack Hogan (Tel 212-232-5335,

Could you add two new categories of products to the database for me.  That

The two new products are:  Credit Derivatives and Bandwidth

		 Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

As an introduction:  The referenced counterparty is trying to straighten out 
the online products it wants to trade with us (it's open for some, but not 
all of the products it wants to trade).

When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved 
to trade, I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the 
European products, including specifically European physical power products 
(which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade).

Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty, I wanted to 
check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the 
products they were opened to trade (especially physical power).

What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties, is that with 
respect to Non Us & Canadian products, as long as they are an Eligible Swap 
Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power, 
which I never open them for.  Also, Credit Derivatives, I never open anyone 
up for unless we really mean it.

So, my question to you is did London actively approve the non US & Canadian 
based products (especially physical power).  If you didn't, then I am going 
to take this as an oversight of the pre-approval process and shut them down 
for European physical power.

I'm not so sure I agree with your name change for US Department of the 
Interior.  I think as part of the name we've got to have that it's a govt 
agency.  Anything else would be misleading to what it actually is.  I think 
more appropriate would be United States Department of the Interior, Minerals 
Management Service.

Hi Mark and Tana,

I called the Dept. of the interior and was subsequently given the number to 
the Director's office.  I was told that anyone there could help me. and I 
asked the woman who answered the phone what the legal name is.  She stated 
that the legal name is Minerals Management Service.  I asked if U.S. Dept. of 
Interior should be included as part of the legal name.  She said that it 
should appear as follows:

       U.S. Department of the Interior 
       Minerals Management Service

I'm about to make the correction in Global Counterparty.   Do you have any 
objection to putting a comma between them, because we do not have 2 lines to 
set it up in GCP as written above?

Per the directions of Sam Schott, I am forwarding this email on to you.  I 
discussed the counterparty name ""Minerals Management Service"" with my boss, 
Mark Taylor, General Counsel of ENA, and he agreed that agencies and 
departments of the US government should have the correct governmental 
agency/department as part of the counterparty name.  You could say ""Minerals 
Management Service"" is a dba for the US Department of the Interior.  We 
generally do not like to contract with dbas, we want the legal entity as part 
of the name.  A more appropriate name for this counterparty is ""US Department 
of the Interior Minerals Management Service"".  The way the exposure rolls up 
under the GCP System is an exposure issue, not a contract issue.  If you

I know we've met before on your visits to Houston, I am a paralegal in the 
ENA Legal Department, in the Swap Group under Mark Taylor.  I am the lead 
contact in ENA Legal for counterparty approvals and day to day trading issues 
for EnronOnline.  I coordinate responses for the whole Legal Trading Group 
(financial, physical, power and emerging markets) with the EnronOnline and 
Credit teams.

I understand from my EnronOnline team that I am going to need to approve 
financial trading for all my Houston based counterparties a week from 
Friday.  Right now that list stands at about 600 counterparties (already 
trading).   I was hoping you could direct me as to what restrictions, if any, 
we might have for financial trading in Australia.  Are there any restricted 
counterparties, such as governmentals, utilities, banks, dealers, etc., or 
any restrictions on the products traded (initially I know we are only trading 
financial power, although I'm sure the list will expand over time).   Have 
your GTC's been drafted with cross-border trading in mind?

Similarly, I assume there will be Australian counterparties signing up to 
trade, and the commercial team will want them approved to trade the whole 
range of EnronOnline products.   Are there any provisions we must add to the 
form of North American product GTCs if our counterparties trade a North 
American product from Australia?  Do we have any tax issues or language we 
need to cover?  Our standard form of GTC includes New York law and 
arbitration.  Will that be enforceable in Australia?  Are there any issues we 
need to address if we require collateral (a guaranty or letter of credit) 
with respect to a trade?

Thanks for your help!",enron_mail/maildir/jones-t/sent/865,6,4,29,3,0,0,1,1,6,6,285,10,30,68,44,4.750877192982456,32,364,1718,120,156,3

There is no documentation to evidence this, it is an operation of law.  Being 
a legal incorporated entity means you are embodied as a legal entity after 
filing or creating certain organizational documents under state or federal 
laws (you could be a corporation, partnership,  governmental entity or other 
type of entity).   A division is not a separate legal incorporated entity.   
It is one and the same entity as the incorporated entity.   It is a ""dba""  
(which means ""doing business as"") or ""assumed name"" for an incorporated 
entity. Any division of an incorporated entity can, and usually should, trade 
under the same master as the incorporated entity (unless the company gives us 
some reason elsewise).  Frequently, the dealmakers at the company may not 
understand that a division and incorporated entity are one and the same, or 
there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their trading from being 
aggregated.That is why we always want the name of the incorporated entity as 
part of the counterparty name when we transact with a division.  Examples 
might be ""Tana Jones Inc., acting through its TLJ Company Division"" or ""Tana 
Jones Inc. d/b/a TLJ  Company"" or ""TLJ Company, a division of Tana Jones 
Inc.""  Frequently, the dealmakers at the company may not understand that a 
division and incorporated entity are one and the same (and we may have to 
talk to them), or there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their 
trading from being aggregated with the corporate entity.  Legal and/or Credit 
should direct you when a division should trade under the legal entity's 
master.

		 Subject: Clarification of Cargill issue

Tana,

I'm hoping you can clarify some information I received second-hand on 
Cargill, Incorporated, and Cargill Energy, a division of Cargill, 
Incorporated.   It is my understanding that Cargill Energy, a division of 
Cargill, Incorporated, is allowed to trade under the ISDA (contract  
96043502) between Cargill, Incorporated and ENA.   Based on the information 
in the Legal Financial Trading Agreement database, there is no information to 
indicate that this affiliate is also covered by the Cargill, Incorporated 
master .  Also, the email from Susan Flynn  does not include any information 
on additional parties covered under this contract.  Finally, Part 4(b) of the 
schedule to the agreement specifies that for Section 10(c) of the contract , 
neither party is a multibranch party.  This is all the information that 
Anthony Campos has received to date on this contract.  Based on this 
information, and from previous requests from Legal for Global Contracts to 
refer any interpretations to Legal, the Global Contracts group could not make 
any assumptions regarding other counterparties not specifically listed on the 
contract or schedules.  

I wanted to verify if what I had heard about Cargill Energy, a division of 
Cargill, Incorporated, was correct and to obtain the pertinent documentation 
if so.  Also, does Legal have any specific ""policies"" regarding affiliate 
relationships?  Is there any documentation we should have been aware of?

I just want to make sure that there are no EOL issues in the future and that 
we have not misinterpreted any information.  Please let me know how Legal 
handles such an issue and what actions Global Contracts can expect.

As usual, thanks for you help and patience.

I got back from vacation late Friday.  Our whole group got bumped from the 
flight in Paris so they paid us $700 each to take the next flight out.  Not a 
bad deal!  But it was 27 hours travel time from start to finish and I was 
exhausted.  Luckily, it was a 3 day weekend here, so I had time to recover 
(and clean from my construction work).

I had a really nice time.  Most of our time we spent in East Germany, except 
for the flight out of Munich.  We went to Berlin, Leipzig, Eisenach, 
Wittenberg, Erfurt, Potsdam, and hiked in the Harz mountains.  My favorite 
time was the time spent in Kitzbuhl, Austria.  It was wonderful, I hope to 
make an annual hiking trip there for a week every year.  It is so hard to do 
anything like it in Houston, I forget how nice the mountains can be.  Our 
hotel was great, smack in the middle of town and it only cost $30, breakfast 
and dinner included!  Such a deal!  

I got home and my house is almost done.  There are only a few minor things 
left.  The garden is at 85%.  My landscaper had a big fight with my tenant 
while I was gone so she wouldn't come to my house until I got back.

I've picked out my two new kitties, and I'll pick them up this weekend, I 
think (if the painter is done).  They are calico cats.  I haven't named them 
yet.

What's going on with you?  Are they working you to death?  Any fun things 
going on?

Several things are not very clear to me and I need to run them by you.

1.  From your email it appears to me that there would be no legal reason 
prohibiting your Australian based counterparties from trading all of the 
products we offer, however, except for financial Australian power, the 
contracting Enron entity will have to be the party referenced on the 
particular product.  It appears that the only product Credit has currently 
opened the Australian based counterparties to trade anyway is Australian 
financial power.

2.  Will you be approving the Australian based counterparties for trading?   
Dave Forster appears to want me to approve Australian based counterparties 
too, which doesn't make sense to me and Mark Taylor.  What are your thoughts 
on this? I guess EnronOnline just does not want a third Legal contract they 
are going to have to deal with on an ongoing basis.  FYI,  I currently do not 
approve the London based counterparties.

3.  The Australian company number.  Does that have to go on every 
confirmation done with an Australian counterparty?  If it does we will need 
to make sure that it gets put on every confirmation.  It is my understanding 
that the confirmations for online trading will be generated from Houston so 
we will have to provide every company number to the Houston Confirmation Desk.

FYI, tomorrow at the end of the day is my drop dead time to get all the 
counterparies approved, because the information will have to be loaded in by 
London when they arrive for work Friday morning.",enron_mail/maildir/jones-t/sent/875,6,2,15,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,258,13,26,42,33,4.748062015503876,23,314,1539,122,143,3

All my home improvements are about done.  I've finally put in central air, 
repainted the interior, exterior, redone the hardwoods and landscaped, 
including a fountain in the backyard.  It looks like a new house!  The final 
job will be new carpets and window treatments when I can get around to it.  
I've been doing this for a year, and as you well know, it gets old living in 
a construction site.

I don't know if this is the final battle with the squirrels, or if we'll be 
at it again for another winter.  I thought I had most of their holes for 
getting in closed, but with all this new construction (the central air & 
heaters in my attics, with various lines coming out of the attic), I'll 
probably have to go through it again this winter.  I vow to prevail!

Tana-

I work in the Tax Department with Mark Ng and I was wondering if you had the 
information on which entities will be included in the ENA footnote as of 
12/31/00.  If you are not the right person to contact on this matter, I 
apologize for taking up your time.  Please let me know the contact on this if 
possible.

to already be in compliance, but just as a precaution, I want to make sure 
you are aware the ECT has a policy which prohibits it employees/traders from 
trading in anything the company trades in.  Any trading you do for your own

Subject: Yes but...........  

I'm afraid I'm still none the wiser . Anyway , points of history : (1) Yes , 
we did , technically , lose the American War of Independence but it was 
because we got sick of it and had other ""fish to fry"" in Asia and Africa , 
plus it was really a civil war because the people who ""beat"" us were , 
largely , first or second generation ""Americans"" and , therefore ,  Brits 
(for example , George Washington's family home is still there close to my 
home town of Sunderland in North-East England ) and (2) we never lost to the 
French , we agreed to give them the worst bit - Quebec - in return for some 
tastier possessions elsewhere .

That fact that you asked ""who?"" begs the further question of what exactly you 
were up to in Houston.  Have the Brits ever really won a battle any way?  
(Their failure to beat a bunch of colonized farmers with pitch forks has 
resulted directly in this Florida mess, and their failure to put away the 
French (of all people) has resulted directly in me and the vast majority of 
my fellow Canadians being subjected to official and legally mandated 
bilingualism).

To the point, I believe San Felipe is the battle field adjacent to the 
Westheimer battle field, where the Brits (or at least one of them) were 
purportedly waging a more efficient war, until being caught red handed on the 
battle fields of San Felipe, where, all the while, the Canadian forces (or at 
least one of them) were so successfully conquering the enemy.

Peter.

Subject: Nice VP and possibly Pres.

When I look at Al Gore I continue to be amazed that one, let alone 50 
million, Americans voted for him.  Both Clinton's and Gore's continued 
shamelessness, and disregard for doing the right and decent thing, is only 
slightly less amazing than the American people (or at least half of them) 
continuing to find reasons to support them.  My only, yet substantive, vested 
interest in the outcome is that we are inundated with US T.V. and I can't 
bear the thought of looking at Gore (and God forbid Hillary) for the next 
four years.  If they don't settle this Florida thing, I am going to have it 
have my cable disconnected.

We vote in our federal election on November 27th.  We will not have any such 
problems however - not because we are any better than anyone (in fact, I am 
not entirely confident that most of my fellow Canadians will understand, or 
have ever have understood, the ballot or voted for who they thought they were 
voting for) - but rather because of the political system which Jon's 
ancestors were so kind to bestow upon us, which I refer to as ""parliamentary 
dictatorship''. 

(Sorry Tana if you are a Democrat, but that is the independent middle of the 
road - yeah right - view of a Canadian observer.  Jon, I cannot, however, 
apologize for the political ruin which your system of Government has brought 
upon us, other to acknowledge that the problem my not be the system but 
rather our screwed up regionalization of your unified parliamentary system 
into 11 separate parliamentary systems - and I suppose that could be 
construed as an apology of sorts, except, for the record, I will never 
apologize to you for anything until you make a public, i.e. to Tana and me by 
e-mail, confession of your sins on San Felipe.  For that matter, you are as 
bad as Clinton and Gore.)

contracts you might need.  My # is x33399 and Leslie's is x36121.

1.  What form of NDA do you want.  We have 2 forms, one where only Enron is 
providing confidential information, and a bilateral agreement where both 
parties are providing confidential information.  If we have a situation where 
we truly are the only one providing confidential information we prefer to use 
the one-way form, it is drafted much more in our favor.

3.  The counterparty's full legal name.
4.  Counterparty's address.
5.  Contact name at the counterparty.
6.  How you would like the NDA sent to the counterparty.  If you would like 
to to fax it, please provide the fax and phone number.  If you would like me 
to email the agreement, I'll need an email address.  If you would like to

Sent for Bob Walker 


A group of us have decided to gather for dinner on the Wednesday night before 
the legal conference and wish to extend an invitation for you to join us for 
good food and fellowship and maybe a few drinks.  We have reservations for 
8:00 pm at Delores Del Rio, which is a small Italian restaurant on the 
river.  They have excellent food and live Jazz music.  Very small and quaint 
little place and away from the crush of the party places on the river.

I will need to give a final head count to the restaurant on Wednesday.  If 
you can join us, or know of anyone who would like to, please let me know and 
I will get directions, or we can all walk over from the hotel.  It is a very 
short walk.

Please let me know if you can attend.

Thanks,

Bob.

Unless otherwise noted on a going forward basis... unless I specifically 
mention a physical product, all physical counterparties will be approved for 
all the products that Credit has approved them for.  If I have an exception, 
it will be noted, otherwise CONSIDER THAT THE RULE.  Most of the comments I 
will have relate to financial counterparties:

For Financial

I am not responding to Credits ""declined"" counterparties.

1. AEC Storage and Hub Services, a business unit of Alberta Energy Company 
Ltd.  BAD NAME.  There is an ISDA Master in place between ECC and Alberta 
Energy Company Ltd.  I will approve financial trading with this Counterparty 
if the Confirms go out under that name.
2.  Ashland Speciality Chemicals Company, a division of Ashland Inc.  We are 
currently negotiating a master with this counterparty.  We earlier sent out a 
draft under a division name, and the counterparty came back and told us to 
change the name to Ashland, Inc.  So, if we trade under the Ashland, Inc. 
name, I can approve it for financial trading.
3.  Bayer Inc., Rubber Division-BAD NAME.  I have already approved trading 
under Bayer Corporation.
4.  Coast Energy Group, a division of Cornerstone Propane, L.P. - turning 
down to trade financial because we have already approved them for financial 
trading under Cornerstone Propane, L.P.
5.  Southwestern Energy Services Company-is a division of Southwestern Energy 
Company.  We have an ISDA Master in place with Southwestern Energy Company, 
which I will approve for financial trading under that name.
6.  Tenaska Marketing Canada, a division of TMV Corp.-already approved 
trading under TMV Corp.
7.  Trammochem, a division of Transammonia Inc. - BAD NAME.   I already 
approved them on the first list, and their master is in the name of 
Transammonia Inc., acting through it Division Trammochem.  FIX NAME!

For Power

1.  City of Riverside - per Leslie Hansen, they are permitted to trade  
pursuant to a GTC with collateral - subject to recieving override letter.

Per a conversation I just had with Saul Laureles, an attorney with 
Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, who has been hired to assist Apache/Shell with the 
assignment of the Fletcher Challenge business.  He said:

Fletcher Challenge would like to assign their petro business to Shell 
Holdings for a short time (like one day or so).  Shell would then immediately 
transfer the agreement/transactions to Apache.  He proposes we get a new 
master in place with Apache, since Apache is a better credit than Fletcher 
Challenge.  He said he will send me some letter showing how he would like to 
do this, along with a draft Apache ISDA (without collateral, of course, since 
Apache is such a good credit).  I told him that I can't speak for Credit, but 
we probably are going to have a big problem on that last point.  We never 
enter into masters without a collateral annex attached.

Subject: Amerada-Hess Corporation

As an introduction:  The referenced counterparty is trying to straighten out 
the online products it wants to trade with us (it's open for some, but not 
all of the products it wants to trade).

When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved 
to trade, I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the 
European products, including specifically European physical power products 
(which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade).

Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty, I wanted to 
check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the 
products they were opened to trade (especially physical power).

What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties, is that with 
respect to Non Us & Canadian products, as long as they are an Eligible Swap 
Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power, 
which I never open them for.  Also, Credit Derivatives, I never open anyone 
up for unless we really mean it.

So, my question to you is did London actively approve the non US & Canadian 
based products (especially physical power).  If you didn't, then I am going 
to take this as an oversight of the pre-approval process and shut them down 
for European physical power.

On the list for 9/19/00:

Leslie is not permitting them to trade power, however, she will give them

2.  Public Service Electric & Gas Co. - My notes show I already opened them 
for financial power

On the list for 9/21/00:  I am OK for shutting Aquila Energy Marketing 
Corporation down for financial, since they are now trading financial out of 
Utilicorp.  However, I didn't want to put ""X's"" in all those darn boxes, so I 
hope by my note only it will do the job.  I am also preparing an assignment 
of the online trades that I will send to the Confirm Desk when it is executed.

of a deal with TMG Financial Products Inc. that is a one-off transaction 
dealing with ""credit sleeving""?

All we have here is a copy of an ISDA with them - not what he's looking for.

Thanks
Linda

Attached please find the referenced counterparty approval lists.  Per my 
conv. w/Frank and Leslie Hansen's emails, on a going forward basis, U.S. 
based counterparties should not be approved for European based physical power 
products, and vice versa.  I don't know how you want to handle that, I have 
not ""Xed"" out European physical power from the attached list.  What should we 
do on a going forward basis?

Per email from Leslie Hansen, one of our power attorneys, counterparty cannot 
transact US physical power.  On the financial side, we just got an ISDA 
Master Agreement in place with this Counterparty, so they should be ok for 
all financial (except Credit Derivatives (bankruptcy swaps)).  We will only 
consider those on a case by case basis.  Per Sara Shackleton, an attorney in 
the Swap Group, there is nothing about this counterparty that would require 
any special reps and counterparty should not in any way be considered a

let me know if this form meets with your approval or if there are any changes 
you would like.  This list will be circulated to the Project Offline Team 
Wednesday afternoon.  Mark, could you please provide me a list of the people 
you would like the list circulated to.

2.  All future requests for NDAs for the EnronOffline Team should be directed 
to me instead of Kay Young.  The request for the NDA should be sent to me by 
email and include the legal name of the company, the contact at the company 
and the company's address.  In addition, each request for an NDA for 
EnronOffline should be clearly indicated as a Project Offline NDA (since I 
prepare many other NDAs for Enron Net Works).  At the request of the 
dealmaker, I usually send the NDAs directly to the counterparty by email, so 
an email address should be included.  If you would like the NDA sent some 
other way, please let me know (hard copy sent by mail or fedex, fax, etc.).

3.  I will work with Travis (or other ENA lawyers, as necessary ) to 
circulate and revise any comments from counterparties.  I will then circulate 
the NDAs for signature.  When fully executed, the originals will be filed 
with Kay Young.  Please note that copies of ALL Network agreements should 
also be filed with Lisa Lees (the original should always be filed with her, 
except Confidentiality Agreements, which get filed with Kay Young).

4.  Kay Young will review my list to determine if there are any NDAs that she 
has prepared that should be added to the list.

If I have missed anything or if you have any comments or questions please 
call me at x33399.

If the attached is not acceptable to Net Works, we can ask Bridge to sign the

A couple of additional thoughts.  The mutual NDA covers Net Works and its 
wholly-owned subsidiaries (which includes EOL).  Equitable relief is more 
likely than arbitration to be the relief sought for breach of an NDA and 
equitable relief is covered by attached.  We appreciate the need to conform

Pat,

This waiver has to deal with a provision in the ECT master swap agreement 
that requires that the agreement and its contents be kept confidential, 
except to certain people like auditors.  It did not allow the agreement to be 
provided to affiliates.  Duke wants to copy the terms of the master agreement 
in has in place with ECT and use it for this Duke Energy International that 
is doing the deal down in Argentina.  Duke Energy cannot even provide Duke 
Energy International with a copy of this agreement unless it gets ECT's 
permission to give them a copy of the agreement.  That it what I am trying to 
resolve, whether there is any business reason why we would not want to give 
Duke Energy International the right to look at that agreement.

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like ""Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc.""  
or ""Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division"".

may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved

I just got off the phone with someone at PP&L and I am trying to coordinate 
our response to assigning our physical gas, physical power, financial and 
online transactions.  Per my discussion with PP&L, Shari is working on the 
physical power assignments, Stacy has received the gas assignments, which in 
it includes an assignment of the online account, and the woman at PP&L is 
faxing me an assignment of their financial positions with us.  PP&L tells me 
that we have recevied Credit approval of these assignments, although I have 
not received such approval.

With respect to assigning their online account, I don't know if Frank has any 
particular issues, my only issue is that we don't only assign an account, in 
doing so we assign all trades under that account, and if the only trades done 
with PP&L are physical gas, power & financial, then we should be alright (if 
Frank is ok, in consenting to the assignment of the online account).  It 
seems to be a problem with her in opening a new account.

Sorry for the delay, I've been away from the office sick.  

In response to your note:

UK = fine
Sweden = fine  (need to check the authority of persons executing PAs and ETAs)
France = fine.  Need to check on the type of entity to ensure close-out 
netting is possible
Italy = restricted at the moment.  We have sought further advice.  Will 
update in due course.
Netherlands = swaps only at the moment for financials.  This may change.

We have not done any due diligence for physical transactions, so the above 
only relates to cash settled commodity derivatives.

Joe,

I got a call from the Coral people that a corrected confirm had already been 
sent to them PRIOR to us getting them to sign the consent to assignment of 
the trade.  I'm sure whoever prepared it on the confirm desk didn't know I 
was working on this, but I told the Coral people I still needed the 
assignment back signed to keep our paperwork straight.  Even tho I hate to 
have to do the additional work, with these EOL trades, there is no ""oops"" 
trade.  Once we enter into the trade with 1 entity of a counterparty, we 
cannot just ""move"" the trade.  We need the consent of the assignor and 
assignee so there is not question later on down the line that the trade was 
not legally moved.   If eveyone on your team is not aware of this, can you 
mention it at your next group meeting...thanks!",enron_mail/maildir/jones-t/sent/1895,4,7,32,4,0,0,1,1,0,0,153,8,13,21,7,4.019607843137255,15,188,803,75,100,1

I am sorry, but there seems to be a little confusion in our shop about who 
your attorney should be on this deal.  I was given Andrew O'Connor's name, 
and left him a message to which he finally responded.  He is now expecting to 
see this CA.  I have now been given Wesley Fredericks name as your attorney.

There was a big computer virus spreading a few hours ago and we all had to 
totally shut down our computers.  Supposedly this virus was all over the 
world.  Maybe we'll hear about it on the news.

I have a meeting set up with IPI next week to demonstrate their system to our 
Global Contracts team leader, the Confirm Desk financial trading head, and 
also Mark Taylor.  Right now I'm working on a summary listing what I think 
our system issues are.  I've traded phone calls with Documentum.  I'm 
actually trying to get this summary done, so I can send it to them to show 
them what areas we may be looking for help in so they can focus their 
presentation on our specific needs.  I've looked at your material for Micro 
Modeling.  I will be contacting them next.

I've got our third paralegal trained, and she's getting up to speed, so I'm 
getting down to the last contracts I'm trying to resolve.  I have another big 
project that ends this coming Wednesday, Thursday I leave for Germany for 
vacation for two weeks, and I hope when I get back to devote my somewhat full

Hey, FYI,

I took your bike by Bikesport on Saturday and was going to leave it and the
guy looked at it on the spot and said it looked to be in great condition.
He aired up the tires and all I need to do is get on it and ride it!!!

Thanks again.

Can you help us figure out who in London can help Anita execute her first 
ISDA, which also will include the usual Secretary's Certificates.  I don't 
know if you know, but Singapore doesn't need EEFT to sign as the arranger, 
ECTRIC can sign directly. Per the resolution, it needs to be a VP, President, 
Managing Director or Chairman.   It looks like the London based officers who 
could sign would be John Sherriff, Danny McCarty or John Lush (?), unless you 
are familiar with someone else who can sign for ECTRIC.  It looks like for 
the Secretary's Certificates, all the Secretaries are located here in 
Houston, so we should probably prepare them for the usual Kate Cole's 
signature.

Anita, you will need to have two signed copies, and initial both copies for 
signature, as also will your London Credit person.

Tana,

I met with Mark Taylor two weeks ago to discuss legal's business requirements 
for the next generation Global Counterparty System.  He told me that you 
would be a better resource than he for counterparty issues.

Do you have time to meet with me this week for 30 minutes?  Attached is a 
list of questions I have about your needs in relation to the GCP system.

Please let me know what time you will be available and I'll setup a meeting.

Regards,

Corey Hollander

hoping we might even have enough time to play a wicked game of African Uno!

Below is the list of the individuals attending the dinner at my home, and

and soft drinks.  In addition, I will make a big pot of white rice to go with 
the Red Beans & Rice, & Shrimp Etouffe.

2.  Make a right on Greenbriar
3.  Quickly get into the left lane because you will have to make the first 
left possible onto a street called Milford
4.  Then, make a left onto Shepherd (you need to go back one street in the 
opposite direction)
5.  The first right will be Banks Street (it is the street right next to the 
59 freeway)
6.  On Banks, go past the first stop sign, I will be the 3 or 4th house on 
the left, a taupe colored, ivy covered cottage, 1920 Banks

never approve a governmental entity for financial trading unless we have a

I'm working on the Merrill/Belco assignment of trades with, I guess, Sara.  
Mark Taylor signed off yesterday on the assignment that appears to again have 
been executed by Fred without Legal's initials.  It appears the date Fred 
signed it is about the time Mark Taylor talked to him about not signing 
contractual documents without Legal's initials.

There appears to be two differences in the redone confirms Merrill sent us:  
(1)  they added a Fallback Reference Price, and (2) they have changed the 
settlement and/or payment dates in the confirms.

Bernice said Sara signed off on a similar Fallback Reference Price in some 
confirms she had previously done with Merrill, so I briefly discussed this 
with Sara before she had to leave for lunch.  We'll look at it some more 
after lunch.

On the change in the settlement/payment dates, I told Bernice they were 
changing the deal and she needed the business guy on the transactions to sign 
off on that change.  She was going to take the confirms to Fred and get him 
to sign off that that is what he's agreed to.

Now, if Sara doesn't know anything about the additional Fallback Reference 
Price, we'll obviously have to take that back to the dealmaker to sign off on 
too.

Are you also working on this?

So that's what's going on...",enron_mail/maildir/jones-t/all_documents/88,4,2,12,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,233,12,27,40,36,4.330472103004292,20,284,1293,115,123,2

Do you only want the form of Credit Support Annex and Paragraph 13 thereto, 
or do you also want a pro forma Canadian ISDA Schedule.  Also, I would expect 
that since you are dealing with Canadian municipalities you would want a form 
that include the special municipal provisions, which are somewhat lengthy?

Tana, Enron Canada is currently negotiating a transaction with 6 major 
municipalities in Ontario (the ""G6"") to provide various services to a company 
those 6 entities are setting up, which services will include physical and 
financial trading (both gas and electricity).  John Suttle is working with 
Jan Wilson of our Toronto office to set the credit terms applicable to this 
entity on both the physical and financial trading side, but they have not yet 
made a final determination.  In the interim, the G6 has requested that we 
send them a copy of our precedent form of master financial trading agreement 
(both the ISDA and our short form financial GTC).  I assume you get requests 
like this all the time and was hoping that you could e-mail to me (i) the 
ISDA, credit support annex, Paragraph 13, etc. that we would typically put in 
place between ECC and a Canadian counterparty to financially trade gas and 
electricity in Canada (ie. incorporating the Canadian provisions), leaving 
the credit terms blank for the time being and (ii) the financial GTC we use 
for Canadian counterparties.

Call me if you have any questions or if there are any problems with preparing 
and forwarding these documents to the counterparty.

In response to your email:

1.  The NYMEX did not have Dana Davis down as a user because he just 
completed and signed his application Wednesday evening and the NYMEX received 
the application by Fedex Thursday.  It will take several days for them to 
process his application.  Further, he still needs to attend their training 
session in NY (I hope this coming Wednesday) before he will be able to trade 
online.

2.  As far as the problem with only one user being able to get in NYMEX 
ACCESS at a time.  I have a call into the NYMEX about this.  We get a 
terminal per seat, so since we have two seats, we get two terminals at no 
cost.  The 3 additional terminals have to be leased from other NYMEX members 
and the NYMEX is arranging the initial lease for us and will pay the lease, 
cost free for the first 6 months.  After 6 months any cost associated with 
the 3 additonal terminals will have to be borne by ENA.  I have a call into 
the NYMEX to find out what the status of our 3 leases is.

3.  Bruce, per your voicemail about you or a member of your group having the 
ability to change operator access to these terminals, changes in the terminal 
operator approvals can only be done by the two seatholders, who are currently 
Mark Haedicke and Kevin Hannon.  Any changes with respect to operators will 
have to be done by full application to the NYMEX, therefore, such process

you can join us, or know of anyone who would like to, please let me know and 
I will get directions, or we can all walk over from the hotel.  It is a very

Please let me know if you can attend.

No, it does not mean that.   Adding all the Enron ""Specified Entities"" would 
only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron 
entities a default under this agreement.   Our concern is that we don't want 
any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan 
transaction which has a swap as a component.

Per our conversation, my name is Tana Jones and I am a paralegal here in 
Houston Legal.  I am your first point of contact when you need to get an NDA 
out to a counterparty.  I work with Leslie Hansen, an attorney in our group.  
She will negotiate any comments to the NDA's or review forms of NDA's 
provided by counterparties.  We can also assist you with other types of 
contracts you might need.  My # is x33399 and Leslie's is x36121.

To draft an NDA I will need the following information:

1.  What form of NDA do you want.  We have 2 forms, one where only Enron is 
providing confidential information, and a bilateral agreement where both 
parties are providing confidential information.  If we have a situation where 
we truly are the only one providing confidential information we prefer to use 
the one-way form, it is drafted much more in our favor.
2.  What is the project or nature of your business with the cusomer?
3.  The counterparty's full legal name.
4.  Counterparty's address.
5.  Contact name at the counterparty.
6.  How you would like the NDA sent to the counterparty.  If you would like 
to to fax it, please provide the fax and phone number.  If you would like me 
to email the agreement, I'll need an email address.  If you would like to 
send it yourself, I will forward it to you.
7.  If you have a deadline for execution, please let us know.

I look forward to working with you!",enron_mail/maildir/jones-t/all_documents/4813,3,3,18,4,0,1,1,1,1,1,260,24,25,50,25,4.157692307692308,35,330,1411,114,134,18

Sam Schott advises us that we are limited to 90 characters for a counterparty

characters.  I discussed this with Marcus Nettelton, our power lawyer, and if 
the following scenario meets with the approval of the financial and physical 
power Confirmation Desks we think the best way to treat this matter is to set 
the counterparty up in GCP as follows and then add this counterparty to the

and online, go out with the LEGAL NAME, not with the GCP NAME.

I do not believe that statement is correct.  The limitation was required in 
the corporate documents of the company, so it should apply to all

Tana,

We now have an application from Tembec, Inc.   Steven Norris, as Treasurer, 
is the one signing the Password Application for Tembec.   When John Cummings 
met with him last week, Steve stated that he would be involved in setting up 
the users for Physical transactions.

After reading the requirements below, it sounds like the two signature rule 
applies to Financial transactions only.

In other words, can we set up Steve as well as his users with Physical access 
without two officers' signing?

If so, then we could get them on-line with Physical access and then work on 
whatever we need for Financial access.

Thanks for your help!

Subject: ClickPaper Approvals for 10/05/00 and 10/06/00

On the 10/05/00 List:  Tembec, Inc.'s bylaws require that agreements signed 
by the company must be signed by any two of the following officers:   the 
President or a Vice President together with any Director, Secretary or 
Assistant Secretary.  If you are going to trade with them online you must 
ensure that the Password Application gets signed by those officers, or if not 
by those officers, they must provide a resolution if any officer except those 
above signs the documentation.  Because of this signatory restriction 
EnronOnline was hesitant to open them for financial trading.  It's up to your 
group, but you must comply with these special signatory requirements.  If you 
would like Legal to pass on the documentation if you are unsure, forward it 
up to me.

pulp & paper and weather under it.
Ambac Assurance Corp. and Salomon Smith Barney AAA Energy Fund - I have a 
temporary ""no"" for them for financial products until I get more information 
on them to determine what they are and what they can do.  Per Credit, AMBAC 
only wants to trade credit derivatives, and Salomon Smith Barney is currently 
not an eligible swap participant and cannot trade any financial.  If we get a 
parent guaranty in that can change their eligible swap participant status.  
In the meantime I am trying to get more information on the fund to determine 
what if anything they can do.

3/28/00 List-I previously had them shut down for all financial but am opening 
them up.   I sent an email about that earlier this week.

Mike,

I know I'm not supposed to continue imposing on you, but if these entries are 
showing up in both places this is going to creating large problems for us, as 
well as giving persons who should not have access to brokerage/other 
agreements access to that information.  Our brokers are quite confidential.  
The only information we want to make available to all Enron employees is the 
master swap agreements.  Can you PLEASE, PLEASE take a look at this for me.  
It is very critical that this drop down works correctly.

You need to speak with the developer.  There is no way to control the 
inclusion of ""Other Agreements"" in the ""All Agreements"" section as the system 
is currently designed.

I am not disagreeing with you; I learned this the hard way a few months ago.  
The system is confusing.

It has been my understanding that the first section is supposed to be for 
master swap agreements only.  Having other documents listed in that section 
may be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for general 
trading purposes, such as Global Contracts.  That is why we created the 
""Other Agreements"" section, to house these other agreements.  My 
understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the 
Master Swap Agreements Section is that they have been done so erroneously.  
The drop down were not created too artfully created, allowing wrong 
agreements to be put in Master Swap Agreements, which has been 
proliferating.  If my understanding is not correct, than when did the 
intentional use of that first section change?  I think putting all agreement 
is a very bad idea.

not just Master Swap Agreements.  It is also listed in the approprate Section 
13 entry.

David,

I know we've met before on your visits to Houston, I am a paralegal in the 
ENA Legal Department, in the Swap Group under Mark Taylor.  I am the lead 
contact in ENA Legal for counterparty approvals and day to day trading issues 
for EnronOnline.  I coordinate responses for the whole Legal Trading Group 
(financial, physical, power and emerging markets) with the EnronOnline and 
Credit teams.

I understand from my EnronOnline team that I am going to need to approve 
financial trading for all my Houston based counterparties a week from 
Friday.  Right now that list stands at about 600 counterparties (already 
trading).   I was hoping you could direct me as to what restrictions, if any, 
we might have for financial trading in Australia.  Are there any restricted 
counterparties, such as governmentals, utilities, banks, dealers, etc., or 
any restrictions on the products traded (initially I know we are only trading 
financial power, although I'm sure the list will expand over time).   Have 
your GTC's been drafted with cross-border trading in mind?

Similarly, I assume there will be Australian counterparties signing up to 
trade, and the commercial team will want them approved to trade the whole 
range of EnronOnline products.   Are there any provisions we must add to the 
form of North American product GTCs if our counterparties trade a North 
American product from Australia?  Do we have any tax issues or language we 
need to cover?  Our standard form of GTC includes New York law and 
arbitration.  Will that be enforceable in Australia?  Are there any issues we 
need to address if we require collateral (a guaranty or letter of credit) 
with respect to a trade?

We then request a new PA from the company with the division language added.

It's pretty darn old and pretty ugly.

1.  It's a Local Currency Form, so we cannot transact cross border/cross 
currency products under it.
2.  We have a 3rd Party Cross Default to Enron Corp. of $25,000,000
3.  We've got market quotation for terminations
4.  No arbitration language
5.  Hard to believe, but we've made no choice of law election
6.  Don't have trade option rep (which probably doesn't matter anymore)
7.  ISDA Defintions refer to 1987 Interest Rate & Currency Exchange Agreement
8.  Setoff language old and doesn't have affiliate language in it
9.  Market Disruption Events not standard
10.  Old ""ERMS"" Collateral Annex
11.  $10,000,000 Exposure Threshold
12.  Credit Event Upon Merger triggers -0- threshold
13.  LC Only Annex - really old LC language/forms everywhere

This is basically a REALLY old, it looks like heavily negotiated, form.  This 
might be a good time to replace it.  I don't know how much trading we do with 
Apache.

Subject: Fletcher Challenge/Apache Assignment

Per a conversation I just had with Saul Laureles, an attorney with 
Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, who has been hired to assist Apache/Shell with the 
assignment of the Fletcher Challenge business.  He said:

Fletcher Challenge would like to assign their petro business to Shell 
Holdings for a short time (like one day or so).  Shell would then immediately 
transfer the agreement/transactions to Apache.  He proposes we get a new 
master in place with Apache, since Apache is a better credit than Fletcher 
Challenge.  He said he will send me some letter showing how he would like to 
do this, along with a draft Apache ISDA (without collateral, of course, since 
Apache is such a good credit).  I told him that I can't speak for Credit, but 
we probably are going to have a big problem on that last point.  We never 
enter into masters without a collateral annex attached.  

I'll keep you posted when I hear from him.

Pursuant to the documentation the counterparty provided when they entered 
into the power EEI, and at the direction of Marcus Nettelton, a lawyer in the 
power group, the counterparty name for the Port of Oakland should set up in 
GCP as follows:

The City of Oakland, a municipal corporation acting by and through its Board 
of Port Commissioners

GCP, if you could please redo the counterparty name, and Stephanie, if you 
could please resubmit the PA to match the counterparty name, then we can get

Marie and I were just looking at the activities list for the Legal Conference 
and noticed you were signed up to ""relax at the resort"".  Not to get you 
worked up or anything, but there is a huge outlet mall just outside San 
Antonio, and there would be no shortage of cheap britches to be found!  After 
all, it has been a few years since you cornered the market when you were 
here, and you probably need to keep up with the latest fashions.  (Not to 
belabor a dead horse, but again style watchers are telling us that the 
fashion for Spring and Summer for men will be knee length ""pedal pushers"".)

In order to deal with the online trading program as well as other issues that 
repeatedly arise, we need to make some modifications to our Master Swap 
Agreement Database.

Foremost, we would like to open the Master Swap Agreement Database to any 
ECT, ECT Canada or ECT International employee that would like access to the 
information.  This would include employees in the London, Oslo, Singapore, 
Portland  and Buenos Aires offices.  The only information we need to continue 
to restrict is the Legal and Credit comment section (attorney-client 
privilege issues).  Access to this information would continue to be limited 
to Legal and Credit  In addition, it also very critical that only Legal and 
Credit have access to the Portland General masters.

Second, we will need to add some drop downs to deal with online trading 
issues.  Online trading will commence by the end of the month and we need to 
have this information and access available by that time.

In addition, we have remaining ""kinks"" in the database we need to resolve.

Can you let me know when you would be available to meet to discuss the 
changes.  Thanks for your help!",enron_mail/maildir/jones-t/all_documents/484,3,7,45,5,0,0,1,1,1,1,192,9,21,44,35,4.729166666666667,19,238,1146,80,104,0

spoke to London about copying it for their other trading groups, and I have 
shown it to other groups, from Global Contracts to EES.  All you would need 
to do is change the contract drop downs.  Contact Mike Neves, who is working

Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)

Effective Date:  05/15/00

Executed Date:  06/09/00

Enron Entity:  Enron North America Corp.

Counterparty:  Pacific Gas & Electric Company

Transactions Covered: All products covered except pulp & paper and FX

ALL PARTIES PLEASE NOTE:  

1. DIVISION TRADING.  This counterparty may elect to do additional financial 
trading under two divisions, its Core Procurement Department or its 
California Gas Transmission Department.  If the Counterparty does elect to 
trade under these divisions, such trades should also be done under this 
master agreement.  No other divisions should be approved for any financial 
trading for Pacific Gas & Electric Company without prior approval from 
Legal.  However, for regulatory purposes, payments cannot be netted between 
Pacific Gas & Electric Company and any/either of the two divisions.  All 
payments must be treated separately.  It is critical that the 
PAYMENT/SETTLEMENT GROUP captures this correctly.

(CREDIT, the agreement does provide for closeout netting.)

2. Canadian and US Trades:  All financial trades with this counterparty, 
whether entered in with Houston or Calgary traders must be done under this 
master agreement.  THE CONFIRMATION DESK needs to make note of this.

3. GLOBAL CONTRACTS:  When we open them up to trade online, we need to make 
sure that all of the financial products go under this master agreement.  
Under no circumstance should they see a GTC if they transact any financial 
product.

3. ONLINE TRADING:  It is critical that  the above information is captured 
correctly before we can open them up for online trading.  I will verbally 
confirm with each of the Online Team, Confirmation Desk, Global Contracts, 
and Payments/Settlements that we have this setup correctly before Legal 
approves them to trade online.

Bill,

I think you are about to become my new best friend!

We have another long standing counterparty we cannot get approved on 
EnronOnline because we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.  The 
Counterparty sent in a Password Application styled:  Koch Industries, Inc., 
acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.  (Which also happens to 
be the same styling on the Master Swap Agreement we have in place with this 
Counterparty.)

They way I understand it, GCP has the two following Counterparties already 
set up:  (1) Koch Industries, Inc., and (2) Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.

The EnronOnline Team has been trained to never set up a company as a 
division, to always send the Password Application back to the Counterparty 
and try to get the Counerparty to resubmit the application with the legal 
incorporated name as part of the counterparty name, which they sucessfully 
did in this instance, but now we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.

Can you help us?!!!",enron_mail/maildir/jones-t/all_documents/11005,8,3,25,3,0,0,1,1,2,2,164,7,21,49,38,4.810975609756097,21,212,1001,66,99,2

The only people that can have full view and edit capability are Legal and 
Credit (for legal/client confidentiality purposes).  Attached is the icon, 
which is just a shortcut link to the database and you can send that link to 
any Enron employee and they will have view access to all the information in 
the database except the legal and credit comments.  I will make a request to 
add the legal and credit people to get edit capability.  I think Denis 
O'Connell already had edit access, send him the link and let me know if he 
has edit access.  (you can just copy this link and add it to emails to 
people, however, I'm a little afraid it might not work from London, because 
it is just a shortcut, if it doesn't, you might need your computer people to 
create a shortcut link for y'all, let me know).

ENA does not have an ISDA Master in place with PG&E Energy Trading Power 
L.P.  Enron Canada does have an ISDA Master in place with PG&E Energy 
Trading, Canada Corporation.  Could the trades be done under that master?

Also, below is an agent that should connect you to the Financial Trading 
Agreement database, where you can look up what master agreements we have in 
place.

Tana,

Can you let me know if ENA has an ISDA signed with PG&E Energy Trading Power 
L.P.  I am looking at doing a financial swap against the Ontario IMO spot 
price with PG&E and was wondering if it could be done under and existing ISDA 
between PG&E and ENA with a C$ confirmation (exactly like the proposed 
Southern transaction).

Please contact Chris or myself with any questions.

thanx,

I just got a call from Stuart Rosman, who is meeting with the referenced

can trade any physical products under the credit terms established by

financial).

Per our conversation, my name is Tana Jones and I am a paralegal here in 
Houston Legal.  I am your first point of contact when you need to get an NDA 
out to a counterparty.  I work with Leslie Hansen, an attorney in our group.  
She will negotiate any comments to the NDA's or review forms of NDA's 
provided by counterparties.  We can also assist you with other types of 
contracts you might need.  My # is x33399 and Leslie's is x36121.

To draft an NDA I will need the following information:

1.  What form of NDA do you want.  We have 2 forms, one where only Enron is 
providing confidential information, and a bilateral agreement where both 
parties are providing confidential information.  If we have a situation where 
we truly are the only one providing confidential information we prefer to use 
the one-way form, it is drafted much more in our favor.
2.  What is the project or nature of your business with the cusomer?
3.  The counterparty's full legal name.
4.  Counterparty's address.
5.  Contact name at the counterparty.
6.  How you would like the NDA sent to the counterparty.  If you would like 
to to fax it, please provide the fax and phone number.  If you would like me 
to email the agreement, I'll need an email address.  If you would like to 
send it yourself, I will forward it to you.
7.  If you have a deadline for execution, please let us know.

I look forward to working with you!",enron_mail/maildir/jones-t/all_documents/4816,3,3,18,4,0,1,1,1,0,0,321,24,51,103,46,4.08411214953271,46,450,1761,122,156,42

We just opened the above counterparty to trade UK financial crude products 
online.  Since the Enron counterparty for these products is ECTRIC we will 
need to get a master in place between ECTRIC and Counterparty.  Justin Boyd 
in London has graciously agreed to let us handle drafting and negotiation of 
the master.  Could you please provide us with credit for this master.  I 
don't know if we can just mirror the credit terms in the old master or not.  
Since the old master is a Local Currency Master, we cannot do a simple dupe 
and change it for UK issues.  I would suggest unless we really have problems 
with issues, we more or less try to sign the same paper whenever possible.

In order to prepare a Confidentiality Agreement, I will need the following 
information:

1.  The company's full legal name
2.  Whether we want a bilateral or Enron Protected Counterparty form
3.  What is the nature of the protected information (what project or type of 
transaction is it for)
4.  The company's address, phone number and fax number
5.  Any timing involved for getting this signed (is there a meeting Monday

Not much going on.  I'm still trying to get Documentum to do a demonstration 
for me.  I keep getting general marketing people, even though I tell them I'm 
interested only in derivatives software, and to get a derivative person to 
call me.  I haven't gotten anyone yet that speaks my language yet.  Then the 
fellow was a little condescending with me about price, like I can't afford 
their services.  When I first spoke to them I told them to check the Enron 
web page to get more information about our company but it doesn't appear that 
they've done their homework.  They're about to lose my business.

In the end I think Mark is agreeing with me that we're going to design our 
own software.  I still like IPI a lot, but they're only one component of the 
project.  The Confirm Desk is still really interested in getting some 
software, and between the two groups it might make buying software for 
document creation more attractive.

		 Subject: Name Change/Merger Notification

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for January.  
To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable Macros 
and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Feb 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

As far as your email questions, my responses are following:

1.  The list I have provided you is the only list that exists on financial 
counterparties.  There is no Excel spreadsheet to follow.
2.  Duke Energy Corporation.  At Mark's direction, I am sending his note 
below regarding utilities.  Again, until we do the due diligence on a utility 
counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local, state or federal 
regulation or approvals they may be subject to.   We currently have masters 
in place with only about 10 utilities/govt's.  We are in the process of 
negotiating another 30.  Until those masters are executed and we have the 
relevant resolutions, authority documents and/or legal opinions, I cannot 
approve them for online trading.  I have made every effort to search company 
websites and elicit from Credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility 
or not.  If I cannot tell by the information available to me, additional due 
diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local, state, or 
federal regulation.   Mark can override any decision I have made, I can only 
make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me.
3.  Montana Power Trading and Marketing Company is a subsidiary of a 
regulated utility.  I am unable to determine from Credit or their website 
what type of regulation they might be subject to.  The note is true that 
Credit says they are getting out of the business anyway.
4.  Petrotemex.   Per my conversations with Mark and our advice from counsel, 
unlike U.S. and U.K. counterparties, Mexican counterparties are not able to 
enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws 
specifically provide for these types of transactions.  We will not know this 
until the due diligence is completed, so I am supposed to say ""no"" for 
Mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with.
5.  PSEG. It is an energy services company; however, it is also not an 
eligible swap participant (or ""ESP"").  CFTC regulation limits the derivatives 
trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain 
financial requirements (large, institutional type investors, companies, 
banks, etc).  Corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth 
and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them.  Whenever I say 
""not ESP"" or ""not eligible swap participant"" it means they have not met the 
financial net worth test.
6.  The American Coal Company.  See prior note.

Does this include original Enron Corp. guarantees?  On the physical side, we 
have the counterparty sign the Enron Corp. document and therefore have an

POWER:  It appears they would like to trade many of the East Coast power 
contracts.  She isn't sure whether the Purchase and Sale Agreement they have 
in place with us would cover East Coast power, and whether it would cover 
firm and non-firm power.  Also, she was wondering whether we trade power 
transmission (I had no idea, silly me).  Further, even if we have a master in 
place with them, I don't know whether we would want to transact under it or 
under a GTC.  My records show they have come thru before through EOL and 
Legal shut down for power (Credit has them open). 
EMISSIONS:  They would also like to transact SO2, and want to get a master in 
place with  us.  I told her I would have one of the emissions lawyers talk to 
her (they are already open w/Legal & Credit to trade emissions).

No, it does not mean that.   Adding all the Enron ""Specified Entities"" would 
only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron

		 Subject: EOL Deals between EPMI and RMT

We have recently traded a few deals between EPMI Long Term California and 
Risk Management and Trading Corp. The way these are booked now indicates that 
a Confirm will need to be generated between the two. Joe Hunter thinks that 
these should probably be book to book transactions. The EPMI Long Term 
California entity has not been used for financial nat gas transactions before 
this. Can you shed some light on to whether or not EPMI should be considered 
a subsidiary similar to ECC or EES.

Thanks.

Thanks for the restaurant recommendation. I would appreciate if you could 
coordinate
the dinner with the students and the faculty. You can expect 4 persons from

restaurant should allow for some flexibility, just in case. If the restaurant 
needs a credit card number

I look forward to seeing you and Jeff Shankman next week in regard to the

You mentioned possibly wanting to take the group to dinner after the
presentation.  I would like to recommend the Palladium Restaurnat, which is
on Locust Walk here on campus.  You may want to view their website at
www.palladiumrestaurant.com  I think they have a nice menu and can
accomodate large groups.  There are several menus from which to choose, as
well.  Please let me know if you would like for me to set this up for you
and I will notify the students and faculty.

Please let me know if I can assist with your visit in any way.

I am writing to ask for your help with some research I am doing with John
Lehoczky and a PhD student.  We trying to apply recent advances in Monte
Carlo for American options to value Swing and other options with multiple
early exercise decisions that are important in energy markets.  I know in
general that early exercise shows up in a wide range of energy contracts,
both real as welll as financial.  Would it be possible for you, either via
email or on the phone, to give us some examples of typical terms for such
instruments?  We would like our examples to look realistic.  We also want to
make sure we are focusing on the right sorts of optionality.

Thanks in advance,

Dear Vince,

Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & 
Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John 
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on 
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your 
schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as 
our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a 
national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also 
possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate 
students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have in mind is 
a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU 
classes.? 

Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to 
seeing you once again. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

Subject: re:developing my electricity model at Enron



Dr. Kaminski:

I am the PhD student at the business school at Carnegie Mellon who is
interested in energy modeling. Thanks once again for taking the time
to talk with me about my model for electricity during your recent
visit to Carnegie Mellon. During our conversation, you had mentioned
the possibility of my coming out to Enron to work on developing my
model, possibly through an internship. Is this still an option? If so,
could you please advise me how to proceed.

Sincerely,

Aziz A. Lookman

 I would like to personally thank you for spending the day with us at the
MSCF program at Carnegie Mellon.  The time you spent talking to us about
Enron, and the energy industry in general, was very much appreciated.  In
fact, I believe some students who were not previously interested in energy
are now interested because of the things about which you spoke.  I have
signed up for an interview for the Associate program at Enron, and I hope to
speak to you again through involvement in the Associate program.  Thanks
again.

Hi Vince


Just wanted to thank you for your participation at POWER 2000  last week and 
for contributing to the success of the conference. The feedback we  received 
was absolutely glowing and we were delighted with the smooth-running of  the 
event. Thank you for being a key part of that. As always, your presentations

difference,  as people are alwyas keen to hear both form you personally and 
from ENRON as a  company.

As I mentioned to you, I have recently been given the  responsibility of

sector under the Waters brand, so I would like to take this  opportunity to 
say how much I have enjoyed working with you in the past couple  of years and 
to wish you the best of luck in the future. Please stay in touch  and if you

Subject: MIT Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar

Vince,

I have received a call from MIT asking if Enron would be interested in 
sponsoring a Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar.

This means that Enron would propose a problem that would have its solution 
developed by students in the Financial Engineering Track. These students 
would present the findings in the end. 

I think that Enron has already sponsored a Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar. 
I remember something about Real Options at the time I was at school.

Please, let me know if Enron has the interest, specifically the Research. 

Talking here at the Weather Desk, Mark Tawney expressed interest. If you 
agree, we (the Weather Desk) could co-sponsor this Pro-Seminar with the 
Research. The idea, then, would be to propose a problem connected to Weather 
Trading.

Please, give me your thoughts about this issue.

Thanks,

Additional recommendation. I think that all weather forecasting support
should be consolidated under Mike (including the weather guys supporting 
power trading). In my view, it was a mistake to remove Mike from
power support. It would also mean a lot to him personally.

[Vince,]
Jeff,

I cannot interview Howard on Tue (business trip) [OK- I will let London know 
this].
I think the organization is very interested in him [Thank you for your 
help...I always consider working for you, primarily- not just Enron as a 
company...my goal is to make you happy and do what you want; My mission was 
to get Howard to you, I understand he will go in front of the directors in 
London- what can I do to help you interview him? I understand that ?Melanie? 
is doing this...and the Manager of Risk at RW is directing Howard. Do you 
want me to set Howard up with you after the second round in Enron London?]

I don't know what ""illicts your attention"" means [Sorry, mistype in the 
car...was traveling to the snow with my girlfriend on a ""mini-vacation"" today 
(I neglect her and took off to make her happy)...I constantly think of my 
work (never peace of mind) and because I remain loyal to you...I recieved 
this email information on Howard today(form Enron London) and felt it was 
important enough for you to be aware of (the 2nd interview) and make sure you 
were happy regardless of where I'm going or what I'm doing (you said last 
time you were going to interview this guy by video conference and Rachel said 
she was going to set it up with you)- I didn't know, otherwise. If I don't 
know something then I can't report to you accurate information therefore, I 
forward everything to you- so, it is transparent or maybe you knew something 
different or something I overlooked. I usually send everything and anything 
related to this guy (Howard) because I know you liked him and I can't afford 
any mi!
stakes- sorry to be a pest. Anything you want me to do please tell me- I'll 
do it. Thanks, Vince. Jeff]

Subject: ENA Analysts and Associates

I have just received word from Ted Bland that no one has responded to this 
memo.  Please re-read the following memo and respond to Ted by July 31, 2000.

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.


As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate 
Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on 
a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly 
improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also 
need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA  
regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.

In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your 
groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's 
in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team 
Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) 
or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our 
A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this 
regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you 
may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A 
resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.

In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you 
to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm 
the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer 
another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply 
their name as soon as possible. 

Please call with any questions.

I am sending you two spreadsheets. Headcount gives  the allocations by major
business units. Please, see the sheet Allocations. Line 83 gives you the 
percentages
you can use.

Budget  spreadsheet gives the budget projections. The sheet Allocations has 
been modified to 
include charges to RAC and GRM. I had to modify extensively  the sheet Detail
to account for the size of the group (as compared with 25 rows available to 
list the
employees in the original spreadsheet). Please, check the logic of my 
modifications
(I hope I copied all the formulas correctly). I had to assume a bonus number.


I shall work on allocations by different business units within ENA
and GRM  but it's chasing a moving target. It changes from month to month. 

I shall be gone for the next 4 business days. Please, call me and leave a 
message
on my voice mail if there is any question. I shall be listening to my voice 
messages.

Sorry if there are any problems. I have to rush to catch my plane.

Subject: invitations to presentation only

Hi Christie,

when do you sleep? 2 am, ugh!

ok,  you were correct, my invitation was to those people within Enron that 
the students talked with before interviewing competitors, and it was an 
invitation to the presentation only.  I didn't think any of them would be 
invited to the dinner, and probably none will even come to the presentation.  
The invitation did elicit one request for the final report though, so maybe 
it wasn't a complete waste.  

I didn't realize that the dinner had turned into a box visit.  that sounds 
great.  I wish the group could have made it to dinner before the first game, 
that would have made the whole slumming experience better.  Now they'll get 
the royal treatment at Enron Field.  It'll be great.

Vince invited 4 people from Rice:

Dennis W. Loughridge, Director of Energy Consortium; lounghrid@rice.edu
Carrie Miller, Director of MBA Program; cmiller@rice.edu
Deborah Barrett, Inst. Communications, barrett@rice.edu
Dr. Wil Uecker, Associate Dean for Executive Education,uecker@rice.edu

Loughridge wrote back saying he'll come, I don't know about the others

Here are the 6 students emails:

""Ritwik \(Ronnie\) Ghosh"" <ghoshr@rice.edu>, ""Ivy Ghose"" <ghosei@rice.edu>, 
""Luigi Calabrese"" <luigical@rice.edu>, ""Pravas Sud"" <pravas@rice.edu>, ""Syed 
\(Farhan\) Iqbal"" <iqbal@rice.edu> 
<cwomack@rice.edu>

your 2 from Rice makes a total of 12 from Rice, I guess

let me know if you would like me to do anything else related to Monday
look forward to seeing you then

Both,

Thanks for your comments and comparisons, it is good to get context.

Based on your comments here would be my proposal

o63,500 basic salary - 
o15K kickers for each of the 2 years - These are paid as a lump sum on each 
anniversary guaranteed.  Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,500 - 
this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus
Increase the value of options to o60K  to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a 
1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.  

Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so 
this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.  

Let me know your thoughts.

I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell
who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows 
of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job.

I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics
society at the University of Houston.

The application of recent developments in optimization theory
and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further 
efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel.

Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives
in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.

Subject: Pricing Power Derivatives

Hi Vince,

It was a pleasure meeting you during your visit to London.  I hope that all 
is well with you.  Steve, Sharad, Slava and myself sat down today with my PhD 
supervisor to more or less concrete what my thesis will be based on.  To 
start off, I will be working on a price process for power that is tied to the 
stack model.  I imagine that later on we will be pricing power derivatives 
off of this or modifications of it.  Steve has recommended a good paper  - 
""Pricing Power Derivatives"" by Geman and Eydeland.  I will be implementing 
their model as that would be a very good departure for me and might also 
prove to be useful to Enron.  The only unfortunate thing is that we are 
unable to locate the paper.  With this in mind, I thought that you might have 
a copy readily available.  Steve and I will continue to look but any 
assistance would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance and take care.

Best regards,

Marcus

Greg,

Two things I did not manage to mention to you at the meeting on Monday.

1. Joe Carson. I was very positively impressed by Joe Carson.
     Enron  badly needs a senior economist of his stature and 
     experience. He has many contacts in the industry and can represent 
     Enron well. He is very pragmatic and, also, I expect a cool head on old 
     shoulders.

     One negative is that he wants to work out of New York. The tradeoff is 
between
     maintaining  his contacts and working closer with the desks. 

2. Tony Mends. I think you, or Louise, should explore the possibility of 
using the skills of Tony Mends.
    Tony and I are good friends so I may be biased. I think that he is a very 
smart
    and efficient person and can contribute a lot to the organization that 
relies
    on processing huge volumes of information.

Subject: Support for Exotica

All

Sharad's investigations of Exotica's status in London have turned up a very 
confused state of affairs. This isn't being helped by the fact that:
1. Anjam is rarely at his desk, and can't be found anywhere in the building.
2. When he is around he isn't willing or able to provide all the information 
Sharad might need to support Exotica.  
This is worrying since much of our business depends on the validity of 
Exotica's valuations.

Sharad will now request information from Anjam via email to leave a trail, 
and I want to alert you to the fact that Sharad will be cc'ing you in on 
these emails.  

If things don't improve soon, I may need to request some assistance in 
extracting this information from Anjam.

Many thanks,
Steve

The Journal of Risk is a more technical and serious publication
than RISK MAgazine.

If the article is published it will give you more exposure in 
the academic circles.  I think it will be a significant
accomplishment.

On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as RISK
among the practitioners.

I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given
by Navroz: the article is fairly long for RISK.

CHARM looks more like  a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it more a
production tool.

We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM has)
in about two weeks, at request of Rick Jones who joined EES from HSB. Rick
worked on a similar model at his old company  and wanted to have a similar tool
for his projects with Enron. I can tell you more about it when we meet (hopefully) later
this week. 

I would tell Willis that the model requires more work before Enron can
consider it as commercial product.

I work for the Market Risk RAC London group. I review the quantitative issues 
arising from Enron Europe models.
I am in this function given my background (PhD from Imperial College-London) 
and also due to my past experience
as risk manager for a brazilian investment bank and Louis Dreyfus.

My agenda includes the review of a number of deals (Wessex, TPL, Eastern, 
...), as well as the 
review of the construction of european gas and power price curves and their 
respective volatility curves.
Currently I am devoting most of my time to the analysis of the UK gas market, 
its respective
price curve and term structure of volatility. 
Bjorn and David suggested it could be very productive if I had the chance to 
meet you and your team
to discuss issues related to modelling prices and risk measurement tools.

possibility of joining the group that works on real options in response to
and in anticipation of Enron's business requirements.  I'm currently
working in the development and application of real options methodology at
Schlumberger.  In particular I'll be speaking at an industry Real Options
Valuation conference in London (http://www.iqpc.co.uk/finance/rov/) and I
just had the paper accepted for publication in Operations Research.  Could
you pass my resume on to the relevant people to have a look at?

Thanks in advance,

Chris Kenyon

Vince,

This Friday during your visit I will be in California for a cousin's
wedding.  I am having miserable luck connecting with you.  However, while
you are at GSIA, Chester Spatt (one of my co-authors) would like to meet
with you if your schedule permits.  I am copying him on this email so you
can contact him directly. Please also let Peirre (who is also copied on this
email) know whatever you work out.

See you next time I hope,

Ken,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
organization
and the Research Group. 

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are inviting Joe Hirko and Kevin Hannon to this meeting. We would 
appreciate if you could
speak, together with Joe and Kevin, on strategic directions of EBS. It is 
important for a group
of technical people, with relatively specialized technical skills, to 
understand the big picture.

I am attaching the preliminary agenda for this meeting.

Vince

Hi Vince,

Winston is telling me that he has started a serious of presentations to 
certain members of your group to help everyone better understand the various 
components that have been documented.

How is that going from your perspective?......are your people getting 
anything out of it?

Also, the VaR documentation was completed last week, and I've just asked for 
a full printed copy of it to be created mand given to your department.

I've just engaged a small team to document the Credit Reserve model as a 
final piece and then we are done with the core documentation.

regards

Steve

I shall E-mail you my standard real option spin presentation + plus a 
presentation on Enron
(for analysts). You can use a few slides to  introduce the company.

I would prefer not to disseminate the information about the  use of AMC. The 
industry
does not know about it yet and I consider it a very  powerful tool (given its
flexibility).

I have the files on my laptop. I shall bring it to work to morrow
and send it to you.

Please, remind me about it on Thursday (old age and the hectic pace here start
showing up).

Subject: Response from Lenos

Vince

Lenos got back to me, and said he'd prefer a high-level overview of real 
options in Enron, perhaps using my notation to express the ideas.  He wants 
me to keep away from the technicalities of my work.

Would you send me your (usual) powerpoint presentation on real options, and 
I'll look at manipulating it to include my diagrams.  My own efforts to date 
have been on fairly limited power plant modelling/asset development, and I 
obviously don't have the high-level view you have.  This will ensure I get 
the full range of real option type deals in my presentation.

If required I could present the real option problems I have analysed, namely:
1. Maintenance scheduling in power plant operation;
2. Gas storage;
3. Power plant asset development, which would include (1) as a sub-tree.

I will also need your advice on whether I can talk about the fact that we 
prefer American Monte Carlo to build our trees.  I haven't used AMC myself up 
till now, I've been carrying out static optimizations, with different price 
curve scenarios being run through.

I'm still working on selling the full stochastic dynamic programming approach 
- people are just getting to the stage of accepting my deterministic DP, and 
they're still being supplied with useful products, as per my ""Real Options 
Strategy"" document.

Cheers,
Steve

Vince,

I hope your day is going well.  We seem to have temporarily run out of new 
people to feature.  Would you mind doing a Kaminski Column for Monday?  I 
think that in the future, I would like to feature Tanya's daughter Sofya, and 
also perhaps see if we can cover some people in our offices overseas.  If 
they can produce the photographs over there, it should be workable. 

Until then, would you like to contribute?

Thank You!

I had rather in mind targeting the same audiences to which Mr. Mehta spoke,
not a general  press release. I agree that a general message to the world 
would 
attract attention.

Vince, 

You are a saint for lending me a copy of your book.  I agree with you that we 
don't want increase there revenues even by a $1.00, although my 
recommendation (and Mark Palmer's as well) is that we should pursue a 
rebuttal for the following reasons:

As I mentioned I scoured  the internet (Britannica.com, Amazon.com, yahoo.com 
and Dow Jones) and could not find one mention of the book, therefore Mr. 
Mehta's distribution must not be wide at all.  Consequently, his comments may 
not have reached a large audience.  Issuing a rebuttal, may in fact, draw 
more attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving.
I believe we should proceed with caution, and respond accordingly (with 
counter comments) only when comments are solicited from us.  So far, we have 
not received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to Mr. Mehta's 
Enron bashing.  May be we should 'leave the stones unturned'.

Let me know what you think.  Also, please contact me when it is convenient 
for me to borrow the book from you.

Regards,

Cindy

Cindy,

I got a copy of the book and another one is on the way from our officer in 
India.
I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important 
chapters.
I don't think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of 
the book.

In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by Mr. 
Mehta. The person in charge of
our Dhabol operation is a Stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an 
invitation
to speak at the same forum  and present the facts as they are. He should be 
here for the management 
conference.

Good afternoon Vince,

Christie Patrick mentioned to me the conference that your wife recently 
attended at Stanford.  At this coference Abahy Mehta discussed his/her 
recently published book 'Power Play' - that certainly does NOT flatter 
Enron.  I have conducted a search on Amazon.com, Britannica.com and Dow Jones 
and I am coming up empty handed.  Would you be kind enough to briefly trouble 
your wife to provide any other information she may remember, so I can narrow 
my search.

I greatly appreciate it.

It seems that there may be an Internet bias as well (more affluent 
and educated households are on-line).

One solution: develop a control group. Arm-twist clerical 
employees of the School to fill out the questionnaire
and also ask them to provide the questionnaire to their friends  and families.

First of all I want to thank you for your hospitality and to apologize

and the turbulence continues.

The outline of commitments with the information on what I have done to 
jumpstart the process.

1.	Review of the CEPEL model / simplified model. Chonawee
started the review process, with the help of our two native Portuguese speakers.
Less complicated/faster to run model will follow.

2.	SDDP. As you know Tom Halliburton is in Norway this week.
They put their grimy fingers on him first.
He will be back next week and will help you  to set up the SDDP runs.
He even volunteer to stay on the job for a few days longer to help
you with the project.

3.	Transmission modeling. Martin Lin will call Dave to jumpstart the process.

4.	Zimin will call David regarding swing option model, option pricing models
for non-standard distributions and truncated distributions.

5.	Cooperation with the SA University in the area of the weather research 
	Remains to be discussed with Jose and Mike.

Good morning Vince,

NEM needs to close above 17.20 to show upside potential. A stronger mining 
play looks like AU.

I want to thank you for going to bat for me as much as I hear that you did.  
Enron was a company where my skills could be very beneficially used. I regret 
that we didn't get to scratch the surface of what I could contribute. I feel 
that beyond being business associates, you and I became good friends. I hope 
that can remain constant through out the future. 

The one true question that I would like to pose to you is this. It appears 
that the political arena here at Enron is currently unfavorable for technical 
analysis. Without fear of hurting my feeling one way or the other, should I 
consider having future opportunities with Enron once, if and when, the 
management situation becomes different?

If nothing ever meshs, that does do stop you from contacting me whenever you 
need Candlestick/technical evaluations.

Your good friend,


Steve

Additional recommendation. I think that all weather forecasting support
should be consolidated under Mike (including the weather guys supporting 
power trading). In my view, it was a mistake to remove Mike from
power support. It would also mean a lot to him personally.

speech for Jeff Skilling this past July.  I am hoping that I can get on your

would really appreciate your input.  We have presented the idea to quite a 
few people in the company, and some outside of the company (Strategos 
Institute), all of which have really liked the idea and provided key input.  
Many people have suggested that we run the idea by you.

If you have some time next week, would you mind allowing me to explain our 
ideas to you?  I will follow up with a telephone call.

All the best,

One last reminder ..
Today is really your last day for scheduling final exams with Linda Werckle
(3463).  She will be out of town after today until exams begin.

Also, please remember to turn in your grades for all of your graduating
seniors by Friday, May 4th.  This is the university deadline so we cannot
miss this date.  The registrar needs final information on each student in
order to verify their graduating status.

As always - thank you for your help!

Subject: University of Texas conference on energy finance, February 2001

Jeff,

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to 
have 
you as a keynote speaker. 

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about the program and  I think that this will be 
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
agenda for the future.

I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.

Thanks for your message. 
Sorry I did not get in touch  with you earlier. The last few weeks were very 
hectic. I am starting 
right now my preparations for the presentation I am going to give at the 
conference.

Here are the details of my itinerary (I shall send you a copy tomorrow). I 
arrive Sunday morning
and leave Saturday morning. The conference takes place on Monday and Tuesday. 
On Wednesday, I am making a presentation at the workshop on value-at-risk. I 
would
like to stay at the conference for the duration: it's a great learning 
opportunity for me.

On Thursday and Friday, as well as in the evenings (except for the evening
of July 18), I am at you disposal.
I would like to take advantage of this trip and learn as much as I can
about the Australian markets and discuss with you the research agenda.
I shall be glad to make several presentation.
I can repeat my workshop presentation on value-at-risk as well as cover 
additional
topics.

I want to ask you for a favor.

One of my associates, Stinson Gibner, is making a presentation to the MBA 
students at

Do you have a Power Point general presentation about Enron, emphasizing our 
growth,
creativity and employment opportunities? We could use it for presentations
we make on campuses to business and science students. There are many 
presentations available on our Intranet site, but the are outdated.

Vince-
I am with the EBS Venture Capital group. We are looking at evaluating an 
investment in a company called Widevine out of Seattle. Part of their value 
proposition involves certain patents on genetic programming. Are you familiar 
with that? If so, can I set a meeting with you and a few other members of my 
group to discuss on Tuesday or Wednesday?

Subject: Re: Summer Internship Position

Hi Vince, Paulo Oleira (one of the M.I.T attending our meeting on wed)'s 
research interest turned out to be a match for April Hodgeson (VP of content 
origination). I had him talk to April (Stinson was on the call as well) to 
discuss his research interest and what he would likely to do for April.  I 
suggested (and April agrees) that Paulo would intern with her and Matt and 
perform research on how end users (consumers and business) improved 
experience with ePowered content can be quantified.  This may include 
performing control experiments at M.I.T.  We decided not to over specify what 
he would do since it is likely to change as soon as he arrives.  I suggested 
once he starts, he will work with April and Matt Harris (VP enterprise 
origination) and they will define what the student needs to complete for the 
internship.  

Addiontionally, Tom Gros agrees that this type of research are needed and 
this is a great way to start.

I will proceed to have recruiting contact the student with an offer to start 
around May 22, 2000 unless someone tells me otherwise.

Regards,

Ravi.

P.S. Charlene, please include Paulo in your May 22, 2000 start group.  Paulo 
will report to me within EBS research group but will work on a day-to-day 
basis with April and Matt. As you've mentioned that compensation is somewhat 
fixed but please keep in mind that this person is a PhD candidate with very 
specialized skill set. Please contact Vince before extending an offer that 
may be too low, etc.

CHARM looks more like  a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it 
more a
production tool.

We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM 
has)
in about two weeks, at request of Rick Jones who joined EES from HSB. Rick
worked on a similar model at his old company  and wanted to have a similar 
tool
for his projects with Enron. I can tell you more about it when we meet 
(hopefully) later
this week. 

I would tell Willis that the model requires more work before Enron can
consider it as commercial product.

Layla,

A few points.

I shall be glad to attend the reception.

I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay.
I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my presentation
(or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and Power 1999):
the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you. 

My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the presentation and
I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her the credit when the
credit is due.  Is it OK to include her as an additional speaker?

Dear Speaker,

Pre-Congress Cocktail Reception - Sunday 13th May @ 5:30pm in the Juniper
Room
We would be delighted to have you attend our pre-congress cocktail
reception. We will be extending this invitation to all our sponsors,
exhibitors and EPRM/Risk Waters Group staff.   We hope this will provide a
perfect opportunity for you to meet all our staff and clients before the
formal opening of EPRM 2001 USA

+ RSVP

I would also like to remind you that I need any missing presentations by
Thursday 3rd May.  It is essential that I get these in as the delegates rely
on these to make notes and get very upset if they are not included in the
packs.

If you still haven't informed me of your AV requirements, please do so as
quickly as possible.  I also require a short biography.

I would like to point out that I will not be taking any presentations on
disk to the event.  If you are using a laptop, your presentation should be
loaded onto the laptop that you bring with you.  You must bring your own
laptop and disc, with connecting cables.

Any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind Regards

It translates into a credit risk for those on the other side of the hedge.
Many producers have a long history of poor timing of hedges.

Here's an amazing factoid in today's paper related to the issue of how much 
money you can ""make"" (sic) by hedging:

...

Other companies analysts say are saddled with hedges include El Paso Energy 
Corp. and Coastal Corp., which are merging. 

A Coastal official declined to comment on the company's forward positions. 

Although El Paso is known for its pipeline business, it produces gas as 
result of its $6.2 billion acquisition last year of Sonat. ""More than 90 
percent"" of that gas is hedged through the rest of the year, said Bruce 
Connery, vice president of investor relations. The forward contracts are for 
$2.40, he said. 

Hedging in the current market plays to the company's primary aim of meeting 
investors' expectations, Connery said. 

""Our first goal is to deliver the earnings goal that we set out, and that 
dictates that we hedge out commodity volatility,"" he said. 


...

$2.40??? Are you kidding????

I agree that it makes sense to put the L1 in place.  There are several things 
we will need from you in order to start the visa process.   The first is a 
fairly detailed job description for Anshuman.  Secondly, we also need to know 
whether or not he will be in a managerial position here and/or managing a

description, just let me know and I will be happy to contact him/her.

Let's get L1 for Anshuman, just in case. I am sure he will stay here for a

to give unfortunately we can not give to everyone.
I am sending a lists of who we have so far.


There are a few names on the list that  I feel we should do something else 
for this year .
under Shirley's list of names.

(not so expensive)

They are : Move Team                                who?

                     Facilities Help Desk                  who?

There are other tokens of appreciation that we can get for them.

Please note that you two are the only ones that have seen this e-mail so far
I will need your approval for all baskets, however your input on the matter 
will be

I would like to invite Iris for an interview in Houston.
She works currently in London Can you call her
and ask when she is planning to visit the States.
We could pay the airfare from a location in the States.

I would hate to pay the 1st class ticket from London to Houston,
though I would go for it, if necessary (I don't
want a candidate to think that we are that cheap).
Business class is a standard
for business related, cross-Atlantic flights. 

I would be more comfortable if you could negotiate this issue.

Hi again,


     I don't recall if I mentioned that my Harvard Doctoral dissertation
involved another energy problem - the Transient Stability of Electrical
Power Systems.

     Much of the data, model and analysis was done with lots of
collaborative efforts with my advisors at Harvard and MIT and with the
Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) in Palo Alto.

The Journal of Risk is a more technical and serious publication
than RISK MAgazine.

If the article is published it will give you more exposure in 
the academic circles.  I think it will be a significant
accomplishment.

On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as RISK
among the practitioners.

I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given
by Navroz: the article is fairly long for RISK.

Vince, 

You are a saint for lending me a copy of your book.  I agree with you that we 
don't want increase there revenues even by a $1.00, although my 
recommendation (and Mark Palmer's as well) is that we should pursue a 
rebuttal for the following reasons:

As I mentioned I scoured  the internet (Britannica.com, Amazon.com, yahoo.com 
and Dow Jones) and could not find one mention of the book, therefore Mr. 
Mehta's distribution must not be wide at all.  Consequently, his comments may 
not have reached a large audience.  Issuing a rebuttal, may in fact, draw 
more attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving.
I believe we should proceed with caution, and respond accordingly (with 
counter comments) only when comments are solicited from us.  So far, we have 
not received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to Mr. Mehta's 
Enron bashing.  May be we should 'leave the stones unturned'.

Let me know what you think.  Also, please contact me when it is convenient 
for me to borrow the book from you.

Regards,

Cindy

I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important

I don't think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of 
the book.

In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by Mr. 
Mehta. The person in charge of
our Dhabol operation is a Stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an 
invitation
to speak at the same forum  and present the facts as they are. He should be 
here for the management 
conference.

Ted,

We have the first running version of VaR model for the MG positions. Many 
thanks to Tanya and Anjam for taking lead
in this effort. We had also great help from Cantekin and Kirstee. We want to 
validate some  inputs
before releasing the number. Specifically, I want to make sure that both 
London and Houston work
with the same position numbers every day to avoid confusion.

A few comments.

1. We plan to set up the models to run VaR concurrently in Houston 
(Cantekin)  and London (Kirstee) with the same inputs.
The reason to do it this way is that we may have to respond quickly to 
multiple inquiries in both locations. (Cantekin and Kirstee,
please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs ).

2. It is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated 
positions and prices on a regular basis.

3. We shall continue work in Houston to improve the model. Two critical areas:

 a. VaR model, by its nature, does not capture one big risk MG has in its 
portfolios. This is the liquidity risk
       resulting from different cash consequences of the hedges and the 
underlying positions.
 b.  We should go through due diligence to validate the process generating 
the position numbers (i.e. look
                      into the details of specific transactions).  From what 
I know, MG has a fairly rudimentary risk
       management system and I am not quite sure how they generate option 
prices (and deltas). They get some
                      option prices by calling brokers.

4. I think the current VaR is within 80-85% of the true number (assuming the 
inputs are right). But, as I have said,

Vince

Tried to find time to catch you when I was in the States during the week 
beginning 10Th July.
Best I managed was to say Hi on the bus one morning.

I wanted to tell you that I taking over responsibility for setting-up EES 
Europe's Risk Management activity and would like to talk to your guy's about 
ways in which they can help me. I know that you are providing a service to 
retail in US. 

Maybe we can talk, or one of your team give me a call.

I am out later today for the rest of the week but will be back in the office 
from Monday.

During my proposed visit to Houston (21st Aug - 15th Sep), I note you're 
speaking at EPRM's Financial Mathematics course.  Any chance of my tagging 
along?  I want to use my Houston visit to get some exposure to derivatives 
pricing, and this seems like a useful course.

Hi Shirley,

[I just called Vince now as you said]

As promised, below are the final dates - it looks like we'll have to move the
dates back as there is no way I can be in Houston as early as June as I have
commitments already booked - there is a chance in early or mid July, but I'd
rather stay flexible and therefore will opt for a hotel to be expensed in 
London
later.

Matthew Williams         Mon 31st July through Friday 18th August
Steve Leppard            Mon 21st Aug through Fri 15th Sep
Kirstee Hewitt           Mon 18th Sep through Friday 13th Oct
Ben Parsons              Mon 16th Oct through Friday 10th Nov

I think the best thing would be to arrange for the period Saturday 29th July 
to
Sunday 12th November to cover the travel arrangements at each end.

Thanks,

Anjam

Ehud,

We shall make  reservations for dinner at Vincent's
on West Dallas (2701 West Dallas, 713 528 4313).
We shall make reservations fro 7:00 p.m.
You can call me on my cell phone (713 410 5396) if there is a problem.

We shall have about 25-30 people at the meeting on Thu at
11:30.

See you tomorrow.

Vince,

Greetings, and thanks for your 6/12 e-mail.

>We can meet for dinner on the 21st. Then you can visit with us on the 22nd
>in the morning and have individual meetings. At 11:30 you can meet the
>entire
>Research Group at our weekly lunch meeting. We can continue
>individual meetings in the afternoon.
I thank you once again for your invitation and look forward to my visit
this Wed.  My current schedule calls for a Hobby arrival on Wed. at 6:23
p.m., in time for the dinner scheduled for that evening.  (I can take a cab
directly to the restaurant if you're scheduling a circa 6:45 - 7 p.m.
dinner.)  Further, I have tentatively set up the Thur. return flight to
Austin at 3:38 p.m., and that can be modified as desired.

>Please, make a reservation at Hyatt Regency Downtown or Double Tree
>Downtown (there are several hotels with the same names).
When I made the room reservation last Mon. 6/12, it turned out that these
hotels showed no vacancy (is there a conference in town?), so the nearest I
could obtain is the Hilton Houston Plaza (6633 Travis) some 3.5 miles away
from Enron.  (If it is important that I stay at the closer hotels, Shirley
might ascertain whether Enron's travel agent can obtain a room there.)

I take this opportunity to request of Shirley that, subject to your
approval, an overhead projector, screen and small lectern be made available
for the room where the 11:30 luncheon meeting takes place.  Also, since I
would like each participant to have his/her own copy, I would ask her to
advise me as to the number of participants expected to attend, or
alternatively, Shirley could make copies of the presentation handout when I
bring the ""master"" copy in Thur. morn.

I look forward to seeing you Wed. and Thur.  Best Regards,
Ehud

I think we can skip the meeting and discuss any issues between us.

I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
Enron Analyst/Associate program.

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
invited.

Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research in
particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).

My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
presentation
and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.

Subject: Martin Lin

Per my voice mail to Vince, Martin Lins offer letter will be provided to him 
on Thursday, August 31, 2000. 

However, a concern was shared regarding the retention bonus we originally 
discussed.  Therefore, based on his PHD and market information we are able to 
offer him a base salary of 98-100K and no retention bonus.  We can discuss 
retention bonus after he begins his manager role in your group.

If you would like to discuss further please feel free to call me.  Otherwise, 
please approve salary structure of base 98,000 with no bonus.

Thank you.

Hello Vince and Mike

I want to keep you informed.

This year all baskets will be done in a timely manner.
On last year we were going through a major move therefore 
many people played key roles in keeping us together.
This year however , is a little different , as it is always nice
to give unfortunately we can not give to everyone.
I am sending a lists of who we have so far.


There are a few names on the list that  I feel we should do something else 
for this year .
under Shirley's list of names.

(not so expensive)

They are : Move Team                                who?
                     Mail Room                                    who?   
                     Facilities Help Desk                  who?

There are other tokens of appreciation that we can get for them.

Please note that you two are the only ones that have seen this e-mail so far
I will need your approval for all baskets, however your input on the matter 
will be 
greatly appreciated.The list is not completed I am still waiting for 
additions.


                    
                                              Thanks

Yes, she referred Norberto to us. We had an informal interview

We would like to  invite him for a round of formal interviews later this week.
Please include me, Tanya Tamarchenko, Ted Murphy, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni,

I asked Liza to talk to you to set up formal arrangements with Enron
HR (a contract, fee schedule approval, etc.).

I shall ask you for help next week when we have more information:
several members of our group  from London will rotate through our Houston
office this summer. We shall need help in making living  arrangements,
including apartments, car, etc. Also, we have an employee from India
rotating through our group this summer. Please, let me know 
who is the best person in HR to ask for assistance.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

The presentation is scheduled on friday the 3rd at 11.30 so that New York
Students can attend.

Would you like me to get you at the airport?

If you want I can also organize a short meeting with professor Seppi which
is very interested in energy derivatives.

My goal is to make your trip to Pittsburgh as pleasant as possible.
Therefore if there is anything I can do to help (I am sounding a little
repetitive...I know) let me know.

Sincerely,

Thanks for your message. In our phone conversation before the meeting  you 
mentioned 
another contractual arrangement under which we could work with  your  company 
employees on a case-study.

The cost of a weekly project  would be $12,000 that would be applied to the 
purchase price should
we go ahead and decide to acquire the software. This project would allow us 
to evaluate the model and
come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support  the model 
internally.

Please, let me know more about this option.

Subject: Molecular Electronics Corp. Working Lunch

On Tuesday, July 25, I am meeting with Molecular Electronics Corp. (MEC) to 
discuss the opportunity for establishing this newly formed company in 
Houston.  For those of you that are not familiar with MEC, they are 
considered one of the premier companies in the area of molecular computing.  
MEC has approached Enron to discuss a possible alliance that would facilitate 
their development and, in particular, location in the Houston area.  MEC 
represents the frontier of computing technology.

I would like to invite you to participate in a working lunch discussion of 
the opportunities and obstacles facing a company that is seeking to change an 
industry.  I would appreciate it if you could join us on July 25  from 11:30 
to 1:30 in EB49C1 for this informal roundtable with the CEO of MEC, Harvey 
Plotnick and one of the founders, Jim Tour.

Will you please let Vanessa Groscrand know if you can attend at 713-853-1769 
or please reply by e-mail to me.

Jeff,

I would like to get on your calendar (together with Jeff Shankman) for 15 - 
30 minutes
to discuss the results of my visit at the Wharton School with Tom Piazze.
A separate message about  this visit will follow.

I would like also to talk to you  about the way we manage our relationships 
with
different universities. Historically, we were rather passive customers of
the academic institutions, trying to hire the best students and limiting our 
presence
on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions.

We should rethink the way we work  with universities. The efforts to get 
the best students look more and more like a hand-to-hand combat and often we 
are not
very successful. It is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses
and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways:

1. Involvement in research projects. For  example, we are currently  
underwriting two research
projects at Stanford University, involving  Ph.D. students of Professor  
Nicholas Bambos
(a top expert on communications networks). We shall participate in formulation
of the projects' objectives and will be given access to the results.
Involvement in research projects allows us to obtain 
access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and 
also to lock-up some very
promising students. Most companies in the high tech industries have such 
programs.

2. Lectures and presentations by Enron employees. Practically every 
presentation
I have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes 
and hiring decisions.
It is important that students get exposed to Enron early in their academic 
program. In many cases,
the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach 
them during their 
senior years.

3. Visits by faculty members in Enron. 

Closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to 
getting the best students
and obtaining access to current research. The universities are very important 
in shaping public  opinion
on the issues critical to Enron's future (especially in the area of 
deregulation and design of new markets).

Currently, the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on 
personal commitment of a number
of overworked Enron employees. In many cases, there is no continuity and 
focus.

I want to recommend a creation of a special function (VP or MD level) 
responsible for coordinating
our relationships with the universities. This function would be separate from 
our Analyst/Associate
program. I have many ideas how this function could be structured.

Subject: UK RAB Multiples

I talked with Keith Harris, our CFO at Wessex, about the RAB multiple graph I 
gave you.  He expressed that the Wessex people had originated the data and 
that the graph was correct, to the best of their knowledge.  The only (but 
very important correction) is that they started the graph at an index of 
100%, which does not imply a 100% of RAB multiple.  Rather, the initial RAB 
multiple was around 80%, implying that the entire line should be taken down 
by 20 percentile points.  Thus the all time hime in late 98 should be closer 
to the 1.3x RAB that I had targeted during our discussion.  Please call Keith 
if he has not yet contact you.

John,

A quick comment about seating arrangements for the weather group. I understand the
new plan is to put both the gas and power weather guys at one location.

My recommendation is against it. If the objective of having two separate weather
groups is to put in place a system of checks and balances and encourage independent views,
the new seating arrangements will nullify it. The power weather guys will 
defer to Mike who has unquestionable authority and experience.

If we go ahead with the new seating arrangements it makes sense to combine the two groups
under Mike's leadership.

Please, let me know what you think.

Subject: Compound Model for Reedy Creek

Alex,

Paulo and I have continued to look at the model and have come up with a 
couple of additional changes.

1.   The cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike 
payment.   Also, Paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be 
discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values.
2.  I would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree 
approach to a one-dimensional integration, perhaps using a quadrature 
method.  This may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities.
3.  Edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for 
anything.   If it is, we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation 
since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma.

Thanks,

Stinson

Dear Vince, 

I'm writing to let you know that I have been in touch with Christy Young from 
the A&A Program and will be finding out my assignment for this summer soon.? 
I am very excited to be back at Enron, and I hope to see the Research team 
again. 

I'd also like to inquire about summer positions within Research.? Will the 
Research group be taking on another intern this summer?? Since I know there 
is no busier place at Enron than the Research Group, if there is a position 
available for this summer that you are looking to fill or that may be open 
for consideration, I would love to connect you to another Rice student. 

Please let me know if the Group is considering receiving a new intern this 
summer.? If so, I would be thrilled to put you in touch with Brad Aimone, a 
senior chemical engineering student here at Rice who will be graduating with 
both his B.S. and his Masters in Chemical Engineering next May.? Brad has 
gained extensive laboratory research experience over the past two years.? His 
academic focus gives him a strong mathematical, quantitative background and 
excellent computer skills.? I believe his skills are transferable and 
relevant to the Group, and he is a deeply dedicated individual.? If the 
Research Group is looking for a summer intern, I hope it will continue 
Enron's strong support and recruit of Rice University students. 

Please feel free to contact Brad directly to pursue this discussion. (As I 
realize the summer months are not far off, if it is easier, an arrangement 
through ProStaff may be made similar to my work extension at the end of last 
summer).? I have attached a copy of his resume for your review.? Brad will be 
in Houston this summer.? His contact information is given below.

Also, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.? I sincerely 
hope that you will have the opportunity to discover the contributions Brad 
can make to the Research Group.? I certainly know that he would gain 
tremendously from the experience as I did last summer.

Subject: RE: 1997 Risk paper on Pricing of Electricity Derivatives


Vince,

I can send you a Scientific Word DVI file (at the weekend) if you can read
SCientific Word files ?  The dissertation hasn't been reviewed by Les or the
External yet - although its been at FORC for 2 months. I think that the
Empirical Chapter is probably the one which would be of most relevance to
both our company's businesses - although I ultimately didn't have the time
to 'explicitly' price the jump risk-premium which I conjectured is possibly
implicit in the prices of exchange-traded electricity futures-options -
rather I developed an implicit estimation procedure which will enable a
rough assessment (with a little bit of further work, but not too much) be
made of the price of jump risk in wholesale power markets.

In other words, I assumed spot jump-risk to be undiversifiable, and
essentially devoted 2 Theoretical Chapters to :

1) proving that a jump-diffusion trading model is ""incomplete"" (synthesising
the securities markets framework with martingale representation theory) -
note that I did not assume that markets could be dynamically completed with
'term structure' securities as in the HJM w/ jumps papers of Shirakawa and
Das and;

2) deriving an explicit risk-adjustment process for 'implementing' the price
of jump-risk using a jump-diffusion marginal indirect utility of wealth
process (ie. a jump-augmented production economy approach in the spirit of
CIR, Bates, Ahn & Thompson).


Incidentally, I would be keen to find out if you or any of your team done
much work on real-asset valuations in a spark-spread option-valuation
framework ?  I'm about to start a project evaluation of embedded
optionality, and have a dilemna whether I should model the spot or forward
gas / power price processes.  With the former, I can model mean-reversion
and jumps explicitly (obviously, important for capturing the optionality of
out-of-the-money plant, which might otherwise be ignored in a pure-diffusion
framework) but am not maximising the informational content of the available
market data (that is, assuming there was a long-term market forward curve
for electricity); whereas in the latter the driftless forward supposition
means that I have to capture mean-reversion via the futures volatility
function, and jumps are less easy to calibrate.  Any suggestions ?

Regards


Bernard

I want to bring  Aram Sogomonian back to Enron at s VP level.
According to new human resources procedures this decision requires
a support of three senior executives.

I want to ask you to express your opinion on Aram (based on a phone interview

Please excuse the cancellation due to illness.  The students do not care who

Hi evryone!

Vince, Vasant and I are very excited about the Tiger Project!  We all 
thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet with such an incredibly 
interesting, enthusiastic and intelligent group.  Thank you for your time!

For those interested in the Houston trip on January 18-19th, please let me 
know by the 15th of December so that I can get the best deal on air fare 
(one-month in advance).

Also, I'll be forwarding the Enron information packages to Donna Piazze for 
your receipt next week.  I am including Jeff Shankman in this reply, as Jeff 
is a Wharton grad, leader of one of our Enron business units, and one of the 
most enthusiastic Enron/Wharton cheerleaders.  

Please feel free to individually contact me if there is anything I can do for 
any of you.

Thanks again for your enthusiastic interest in Enron!

I know that Peter Tufano was working on it  but when  I checked the HBS
site and tried to purchase it, I could not locate it. 

When I talked to Peter a few months ago, he told me that the case study was 
ready
 and he  was going through Enron's internal approvals.

I cc Mark Palmer on it. Maybe he knows about this specific case study.

I wander if it was completed, given Sutton Bridge developments.

Vince-

Where might I find copies of the case studies Enron has published?  I'm 
particularly interested in the Sutton Bridge publication for Havard but would 
like to know if there is a library of case studies.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

        I sent my resume to your well respected company a few weeks ago
in regards to establishing a long-lasting career with them. I never
received a response and was wondering if you knew who was in charge of
the electric power disbatching/scheduling department or know of who I
may contact to inquire this information? I know you are a very busy
professional and I apologize for the inconvenience.  Thank you for your
valuable time.

Warmest Regards,

Subject: MATLAB at Enron


Hello Vince :

I'm the Territory Manager for the MathWorks, we develop MATLAB technical
software. We've recently developed tools well suited for Energy Trading
Industry.

Enron has used our products in the past, but all of those end-users have
left Enron.

Risk Management and Research groups at Southern Energy, TXU, Dynegy, El
Paso Energy, Koch, Calpine, Reliant and others have recently started using
our products in the following ways.

1. Create sophisticated option pricing models, risk analysis models, and
stress analysis models. Creating GUI front ends for the end-users.
2. Pull in Data from ODBC, Corba, and SAS databases to evaluate.
3. Visualize the results and quantify the solution.
4. Compile these models and distribute these applications to their
Traders, Analysists and Managers with no distribution costs.

Who should I contact at your company to discuss Enron's situation to see if
our can help Enron as it has with our other Energy customers?


Thank you for your time and help.

I wanted to give you some feedback.  Elena Chilkina has gone way above the 
call of duty to help me on a very important research project.  I am trying to 
conduct some research on the global fuels market for Jeff Shankman.  When I 
mentioned this to Elena, she was extraordinarily helpful in helping me 
compile some very useful information on very short notice.  She was able to 
quickly define the scope of the project and gather some pertinent 
information. Because this was not one of her regular assignments, she put in 
many extra hours to help us out on this project.

I just wanted to let you know about a job well done.

Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a ""KWI Users Forum"" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

* a general energy risk related topic
* a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
* your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards


David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

Subject: Thomas Knudsen

Dale, Vince

As you all know I have attempted to get Thomas Knudsen interviewed as a 
result of Prof Lane Hughston's recommendation (Lane is an acquaintance of 
Vince and me, and is a very senior figure in the world of quant finance).  
Anjam vetoed the idea of interviewing Thomas since he was ""too old and too 
experienced"".  Since I felt that Thomas has some merit, I asked Houston to 
have an informal chat with Thomas.  Houston wish to pursue the interview 
process further, and Anjam has set about setting up the interviews.  I'm 
somewhat concerned about the way in which Anjam is going about this, since it 
seems he's trying to put up barriers to these interviews.

I received a concerned email from Thomas Knudsen this morning in which he 
recounts some strange conversations with Anjam.  He says he received a call 
from Anjam on Thursday (13th April) evening (outside office hours), asking 
how he got his CV into Enron (I'd shown Anjam the email and CV back in early 
February), and how Anjam could contact him (despite the fact he was 
contacting him at that moment).

Anjam then called Thomas on his work number (bad form) on Friday 14th asking 
Thomas to come in for interviews on Monday (one working day's notice).  
Thomas told Anjam he was going on holiday on Wednesday of this week, and that 
he'd have to see if he could make time given the need to tidy up some things 
at work.  He said he'd contact Anjam on Monday (today) to confirm his 
availability.

Today (17th April) Thomas called Anjam to say he couldn't make it, and that 
he wouldn't be able to make it for two weeks (not so serious, he thought, 
given that we're losing time to Easter anyway).  Anjam told Thomas that the 
position might be filled in two weeks' time.

Thomas is concerned about missing the boat, and I for one didn't even realise 
it was leaving so soon!

Can anyone shed any light on this?

Steve

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

Let me briefly introduce myself, I am the Director of Corporate Relations
for the School of Engineering at Stanford University.  In this role, I am
always on the watch for ways to bring our faculty together with companies
that have an appetite for engagement with top tier research institutions.

I believe you know Hill Huntington, who is a senior researcher with
Stanford's Energy Modeling Forum.  He suggested I get in touch with you for
some ideas about contacts at Enron.  I'm in the process of planning a trip
to Texas in early May along with my colleague Donna Lawrence, the
university's Director of Corporate Relations.  We were hoping to be able to
include a stop at Enron on our itinerary. Right now it appears that Friday,
May 4th would work best for us but we're at the very beginning of our trip
planning.

The purpose of our visit would be to review the current relationship
between Enron and Stanford, to give you an overview of current priorities
in the School of Engineering, and ask for your help in identifying the best
points of contact.

I look forward to hearing from you about your availability,

Jeff,

We shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from Sandeep with the 
numbers you have 
requested.  What follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on 
the power situation in India
published by The Financial Times. 

The first article describes recent power outage in northern India affecting 
millions of people.
One possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of  output lost due 
to  power
shortages. It is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost 
of power produced
by the Dhabol plant (expensive as it may be). The power cut affected 230

                     ASIA-PACIFIC: Power failure hits north India 
                     Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001
                     By ANGUS DONALD

                     Tens of millions of people were left without electricity 
in northern India
                     yesterday after a power grid breakdown. 

                     Electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and 
most parts of the
                     capital New Delhi, with 60 to 70 per cent of supply 
expected to be restored
                     by the end of the day, according to power grid 
officials. 

                     The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
(Assocham), a
                     leading business organisation, expressed ""deep concern"" 
and called for a
                     mechanism to prevent future disruption that could 
""cripple the economy"". 

                     The power failure across eight Indian states, including 
New Delhi, disrupted
                     train services, water supplies and the telephone network 
and forced
                     hospitals to switch to emergency generators. 

                     The fault occurred on the Northern Grid, which provides 
electricity for 226m
                     people, and affected the states of Delhi, Haryana, 
Punjab, Uttar Pradesh,
                     Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu 
and Kashmir. 

                     A breakdown at a sub-station in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, 
India's most
                     populous state, caused an overload of power on other 
lines, which then
                     failed as well. 

                     Trains stopped running for most of the day and signals 
systems were
                     damaged. New Delhi international airport was also 
slightly affected before
                     its own power supply could be engaged. 

                     ""We will probe into the reasons for the failure. It is 
most likely to be a
                     technical failure, but we will investigate why it 
happened,"" Suresh Prabhu,
                     the power minister, was quoted as saying by Press Trust 
of India. 

                     India suffers regularly from power problems because of 
lack of funding to
                     upgrade infrastructure. Theft of supplies is also a big 
problem. Thirty per
                     cent of the country's electricity is stolen, according 
to analysts. In New
                     Delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen. 

                     Two years ago, a power failure blacked out Uttar Pradesh 
and Delhi for
                     hours. 

                     Assocham issued a statement, saying that increasing 
industrial demand
                     would exacerbate the problems already faced by India's 
inefficient power
                     sector. ""The slow progress, particularly in 
strengthening the transmission
                     and distribution system, and ever increasing theft will 
contribute to
                     worsening the power supply situation further.""

                     ASIA-PACIFIC: Energy group launches image offensive: 
Enron has a
                     plan to reverse its reputation as a profiteering 
multinational
                     operating in India, writes Khozem Merchant 

                     Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001
                     By KHOZEM MERCHANT

                     Enron, the US energy producer and a constant target of 
criticism in India, is
                     hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a 
profiteering
                     multinational. 

                     Its ""myth and reality"" offensive in local newspapers 
follows the west Indian
                     state of Maharashtra's decision to review the tariff it 
pays the Texas-based
                     company, whose Dollars 2.2bn electricity generating 
plant at Dabhol is
                     India's biggest single foreign investment. 

                     Maharashtra's tariff has more than doubled since 1993 
and is three times
                     greater than that charged by other independent power 
producers (IPPs).
                     The tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the 
rupee against the
                     dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha 
fuel. The state also pays
                     a fixed capacity charge of Rs970m (Dollars 21m) a month, 
reflecting the
                     huge project cost and, controversially, irrespective of 
consumption. 

                     A showdown looks inevitable, reminiscent of a clash six 
years ago that
                     damaged India's appeal to foreign investors. A former 
official of the World
                     Bank, which has criticised the deal, says Enron is 
emerging ""as the East
                     India Company of the 21st century"" - a reference to the 
British trader that
                     colonised key areas of the Indian economy in the 19th 
century. 

                     The stand-off is the latest blot on India's power 
sector. The UK's PowerGen
                     and Cogentrix of the US have quit India recently, 
frustrated by long approval
                     procedures, inadequate payments mechanisms or because of 
higher
                     returns elsewhere. 

                     ""India has lost time and opportunity and has driven 
returns down by six
                     percentage points,"" says Gerry Grove-White, former India 
general manager
                     of PowerGen, which has sold its 655MW plant in Gujarat 
to China Light &
                     Power of Hong Kong. 

                     India's national plan for the five years to 2002 says 
generating capacity
                     must rise by 40,000MW to about 120,000MW. But since 
1992, IPPs have
                     added only 3,000MW and 2,500MW remains under 
construction. This is
                     insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8 
per cent economic
                     growth. 

                     Enron was a bellwether of India's liberalisation, 
winning fast-track project
                     approval in the early 1990s. Phase 1, a 740MW plant 
fuelled by expensive
                     naphtha came on stream in May 1999, and phase 2, a 
Dollars 1.87bn plant
                     of 1,624MW capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied 
natural gas (LNG),
                     will be completed this year. Only two of seven other 
fast-track proposals
                     have achieved financial closure. 

                     From the outset Enron encountered attacks, culminating 
in Maharashtra's
                     then nationalist government cancelling the project 
before renegotiating
                     terms no less onerous. Vilasrao Deshmukh, chief minister 
of the successor
                     government, says the power purchase agreement is 
unaffordable. 

                     Enron, whose attackers also include cultural 
chauvinists, wants to maintain
                     good political relations in a hostile but lucrative 
environment. Enron views
                     India as a testing ground for its evolution from a 
traditional manager of
                     power plants to a broad-based trader of commodities, 
such as energy, gas
                     and bandwidth. 

                     To support these ambitions Enron hopes to trade energy 
between power
                     surplus and deficit states, once legislation is passed 
this year. It is building
                     an LNG terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural 
gas. And it is
                     laying a 15,000km fibre-optic network to trade bandwidth 
space in a country
                     desperately short of this new economy commodity. 

                     In any event, Enron believes it has a watertight 
contract. It is supported by
                     many that believe any subversion of the contract would 
confirm investor
                     perception of Maharashtra, India's financial and 
industrial hub, as an
                     unreliable destination for investment. 

                     Mr Deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his 
predecessor, which
                     threatened to ""dump Dabhol into the Arabian Sea"" - is 
under pressure from
                     radical members of his wobbly coalition. But his options 
are limited.
                     Scrapping the project would be ruinous for an 
economically troubled state
                     that would have to compensate shareholders. 

                     Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the local utility 
and Enron's main
                     client, is obliged to dispatch or ""off-take"" 90 per cent 
of Dabhol's output. Yet
                     MSEB has never honoured these guarantees. Its off-take 
has averaged 60
                     per cent since the plant opened and, in effect, MSEB has 
been paying a lot
                     more while consuming a lot less power. 

                     One reason off-take is low is because the state's tough 
new regulator has
                     told MSEB to buy from cheaper sources. Enron says the 
tariff would be
                     Rs4.02/kWh if MSEB's off-take averaged 90 per cent. But 
with off-take a
                     third lower, the average tariff is Rs4.94 per unit, and 
often higher. In
                     October, the tariff was Rs6.91 per unit, when off-take 
was about 49 per
                     cent. Enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2, 
run on cheaper
                     LNG, starts. 

                     These cost pressures have forced MSEB to take up only 
half of a 30 per
                     cent equity option in phase 2. Enron has acquired the 
balance and
                     mandated bankers to find a buyer. 

                     Enron's difficulties have undermined the appeal of IPPs, 
which have failed to
                     deliver the flood of investments. Potential IPPs feared 
they would never be
                     paid by state generating boards that have become a 
byword for corrupt
                     management of power. 

                     Reform of state electricity boards, whose uneconomic 
pricing means
                     industrial users subsidise poor farmers, as well as 
transmission and
                     distribution (T&D) services to check huge theft and 
technical losses, is
                     overdue. ""Given the limited resources, money would be 
better spent on T&D
                     rather than on new plant,"" says Oliver Blackaby, 
managing director of N M
                     Rothschild in India, which is advising Karnataka on the 
privatisation of its
                     distribution network. 

                     For the moment, attention is fixed on Enron's ability to 
satisfy the
                     competing interests of investors and clients. As Sanjay 
Bhatnagar, chief
                     executive officer of Enron India, said in a recent trade 
magazine, one of the
                     key lessons learned from phase 2 is ""having flexibility 
to deal with
                     externalities"".

Jeff,

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to 
have 
you as a keynote speaker. 

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about the program and  I think that this will be 
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
agenda for the future.

I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.

Dr. Kaminski,
I think I'll be able to start work from the last week of May,
but not from monday,
probably, I'll be able to work from 5/30 (wed).
Will it be good? I know it is not that much earlier than I mentioned..6/4
I am sorry.

And actually, there is an e-business conference at Haas school of business,
organized by my advisor
Could you distribute the link and the attached invitation letter to groups
interested in e-business and especially procurement?
The link is as following.
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/citm/conferences/010522/

I am afraid you might forgot this I told you in the last email...
My advisor (Arie Segev at Haas school of business; segev@haas.berkeley.edu)
wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him
during the summer, while I am staying there.
His interest is in e-business.. (what else..?)
and has expertise in e-procurement system and marketplace...
XML based standard such as OBI,cXML, xCBL, RosettaNet, BizTalk ..
system interoperability study, auction and negotiation, workflow system,
e-catalog management, digital signature, EDI, etc etc...
many technical aspects of e-business...
He wants to do some kind of technical case study
that is beneficial for both ENRON and him.
He may travel one or two times to Houston to have a meeting during the
summer.
(And to be frankly, this will be good for me too,
because I can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in Houston..)
Could you think about the possibility of joint research, with him?

Thank you..

Sincerely,
Jinbaek

David,

During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues 
related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.

Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system:
we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds
of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery 
is poor 
and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the 
problem by mapping
them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.

We have agreed on the following:

1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can 
increase the number
of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will 
investigate the impact of a larger
number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.

2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity 
should be
modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense 
to monitor
the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less 
transparent aggregates.

3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be 
systematically
monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the 
trading positions.
This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the 
responsibility is
dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody
is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task;
cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.

It's a good software package for mathematical modeling,

The more I think about  it, the more I am convinced it would be difficult

Subject: Summer visits  

Vince

Thanks for offering to look my presentation over.  The deadline for 
submission has been extended until tomorrow (Friday), so there's less of a 
hurry.

As regard our summer visits, we'll need to speak to Dale over the budget.  
Personal commitments mean it's difficult for me to take two whole months to 
visit, so if the cost is prohibitive I may need to make just one shorter 
visit.  I'd obviously like to spend longer, and two visits seems to be the 
only way I can do it.  I believe the situation is similar for Kirstee.

I've persuaded Richard to pay for Matt's visit in its entirety, and I've no 
doubt that RAC/Credit Trading will pick up the bills for Ben and Kirstee.  
It's difficult to think who'd be the natural group to pay for me.  I honestly 
think I'll have difficulty persuading, e.g. Richard, that it's worth his 
while to pay for my visit.  I get the impression he thinks I'm doing OK 
without the need to go to Houston for further training.

I'm interviewing a candidate for Bjorn's model review role during today's 
videoconference, so we'll need to speak beforehand or perhaps Friday.

All the best,
Steve

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I currently hold a post-doctorate position in the Mathematics
Department at the University of Texas at Austin (with a Ph.D.
in theoretical physics). Although my position here is renewable
until summer 2001, I would like to move on to a more dynamic field
where I can still use my analytical skills and mathematical knowledge.
Since attending a series of lectures on mathematical finance given
by Dr. Marc Potters last summer I started studying the subject on my
own and found it intriguing and challenging.

I am interested in a position in your group (RAC) at Enron.
Last fall in a Career seminar at UT you mentioned that people who are
interested can send you their resume. If this is still relevant, please
find below my resume (in Word 97 and text formats).
Thank you for your time.

Lance,

I could not open the attachment.
I concur with Vasant. We always face a challenge with summer interns: we 
don't want
to expose them to too much information. We typically look for a 
self-contained project 
and limit intern's access to additional information.

Hi Lance,

 he looks very good.  How would you plan on using him?  My only concern about 
using a summer intern would be that I would not want him to learn all about 
Enron's operations in power trading and then go work somewhere else.  But if 
you think we can use him in a more generic manner where you give him 
specialized projects and you yourself deal directly with the traders, then 
that may be a possibility.  If you agree, let us check with Vince and then 
interview him.

Sheila,

I am forwarding you a message I received a few days ago. I want to ask you 
for advice how to handle this case.

My first  reaction was to ignore it. The longer I think about it, the more 
convinced I become that some action 
is required.

Let's try to reverse the situation and assume for the sake of argument that a 
female employee
was harassed by a male colleague. An employee informs her boss a few months 
later about
the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it. In many similar 
cases, courts  subsequently 
found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such 
complaints.

The fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is 
immaterial. 
If I ignore this complaint I may expose the company to charges of double 
standard in
handling sexual harassment cases.

My recommendation would be to ask Maureen to attend sensitivity training and 
sexual harassment prevention class.

Please, let me know what you think. Sorry to burden you with this case.

Dear Mr Kaminski,

Firstly, I wanted to tell you how privileged I feel to be considered for
some of the opportunities within your prestigious firm.
I am strongly interested in what Enron Global Markets has to offer in its
research side.  Your Training Program is widely recognized within the
financial industry as being one of the best, and I would be more than
honored to be part of it.  I believe that as member of Enron I can learn a
lot more quantitative ways of trading energy products, and I can also learn
how to get a feel for the Energy markets from some of the best people in th=
e
business.
Thus, I would sincerely appreciate to be considered as a potential member o=
f
your rotational program.  Indeed, I believe that my employment experiences
have provided me with valuable skills that will be very useful in your
Group.  These skills include the ability to synthesize quantitative
information quickly and accurately, the facility to deal with sophisticated
financial products, and more importantly the ability to work as part of a
team by fulfilling responsibilities diligently and sometimes prior to
deadlines.  I genuinely hope to contribute to Enron=01,s success by bringin=
g
these skills, along with my strong mathematical background and knowledge of
the Energy Industry.
Finally, I wanted to commend you on your high level of professionalism, and
the clarity with which you exposed the opportunities available within Enron=
.
You surely are a genuine proof that your Group is committed to working with
people who exhibit a superior level of professional capabilities.

Sincerely Yours,

Dear all,

Thanks for your responses regarding availability and thoughts for the 2001
financial maths course. Attached is a word version of the previous outline.
I have also included some comments from previous delegates on what they
would like to see this year. Most points address the level we should aim for
and the balance of theory and practical applications. I hope these points
help you to improve on what is already our premier EPRM training course.

I would like to confirm the final points and any new biographical details by
Thursday, March 22nd in order to allow us a strong lead time to market the
event. If you have any questions, please call me on 212 925 6990 extension
225 or send me an email.

As a checklist these are the points I would like to clarify:

1. Confirmed availability for venues outlined in the draft programme.
 London, 28 & 29 June
 New York, 9 & 10 July
 Houston, 16 & 17 July

Unless specified on the draft, each speaker is down for each of the three
venues. Please let me know if this is not possible.

2. Updated talk titles and bullet points. These should be updated to reflect
the developments in the energy markets since September 2000.
3. Full name and job titles as you wish them to appear on the brochure.
4. Updated biographies. I will assume that the biographies from previous
courses are correct unless told otherwise.
5.  Mailing addresses for the speaker packs.

Overall, the response to the 2000 events was extremely positive with a very
high satisfaction rate. Key points from delegate feedback were as follows:

1. The challenge for this course is to maintain the right balance between
theory and practice. Delegates have requested the most advanced research and
mathematical theory for inclusion. The flip-side of the coin is that they
also would like as many practical examples as possible. On the attached
draft, where PRACTICAL EXAMPLE(S) are included as the final bullet point I
would like to include a one line description of the practical example you
will provide for the audience.

2. Delegates have requested more time spent on actual modelling rather than
examinations of quantitative discussions of the energy markets in general.
Again, I think that we provide a good balance between the two.

3. Basically, the audience who attend this are eager to attend the most
advanced financial mathematics course available for energy practitioners. I
think that with the current market developments this approach combined with
the impact of recent events we will have an extremely topical and exciting
event this July.


I look forward to seeing your responses next week. Please contact me to
discuss the existing arrangements for travel and accommodation
reimbursement.

Best wishes,

Paul Bristow

Toni:

We talked to Rabi. He's sitting on the fence for some good reasons, and he 
has to weigh what is fairly comfy job situation for one that starts out at a 
lower level but has more potential.   WRT the GREEN, Vince verbally offered 
salary of $105k plus a guarantee that his bonus at year end would be a 
minimum of $15k cash.  That's in addition to the $15k sign on bonus.  Vince 
said that we would not bother working up a revised offer letter unless and 
until Rabi came back with a verbal ok.  He will ponder the offer; probably 
for a few more days and get back with us.  He may well call you to discuss 
the exact details of the benefits.  ESOP, 401(k) contributions, etc.

There was a problem with the request. I could not approve it (the system would
not let me do it). There must have been a  mistake in the way it was 
submitted).
Please, ask Shirley to resubmit.

Vince,

A few weeks ago we talked about installing an additional Bloomberg terminal 
on the 31st floor for Mike's weather team.
 I have submitted a security request, and we are now waiting for your 
approval.  
Could you, please, go over that request and give Mike Roberts and me your 
feedback?

Subject: summer internship



Hi Vince,

I am writing you at this time to inquire as to the potential of renewing my
internship at Enron for the Summer of 2000.

While the date of my request is later than I would have wished, the reason
is that I had originally planned to go back to Turkey this summer and get
my mandatory military duty done. However, I now realize I can put it off to
a further date. That left me wondering if you believe there is a project
that I can get involved in this summer and be useful. If that were the
case, I would be more than happy to postpone my military duty and spend the
summer with the research group. I discussed this with Dr. Ronn, and he is
very supportive of this idea.

I apologize again for bringing up this issue late, and look forward to
hearing from you.

Best regards,

The science of measuring operational risk is in its early stages of 
development.
There are really no cook-book  solutions. One has to use creativity and a lot
of common sense.

Subject: Operational Risk

Mr. Kaminsky,

Recently, I read articles published by GARP and monographs in a book 
published by GARP.  Although they are excellent sources of introduction to 
operational risk, none of them have any details on the ""how to.""

If you know of a good book or book(s) could you recommend one?  

Thank you.

Subject: MIT Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar

Vince,

I have received a call from MIT asking if Enron would be interested in 
sponsoring a Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar.

This means that Enron would propose a problem that would have its solution 
developed by students in the Financial Engineering Track. These students 
would present the findings in the end. 

I think that Enron has already sponsored a Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar. 
I remember something about Real Options at the time I was at school.

Please, let me know if Enron has the interest, specifically the Research. 

Talking here at the Weather Desk, Mark Tawney expressed interest. If you 
agree, we (the Weather Desk) could co-sponsor this Pro-Seminar with the 
Research. The idea, then, would be to propose a problem connected to Weather 
Trading.

Please, give me your thoughts about this issue.

Thanks,

Claudio

Vince:  Pursuant to Bjorn's suggestion and my voice mail message,
attached you will find the background information on Jim Woods.  Jim is
not a pure quant  and enjoys much more the areas of strategic thinking
and related processes.  From what I can tell, he enjoys the process of
creating an arguement for a client's position in some disputed matter.
He is looking forward to having an opportunity of meeting you.  His
availability next week is only on Wednesday.  An early breakfast at the
Hyatt would work great for him.  Please let me know if that might work.
If not, when?  Al Arfsten

A few comments on the model:

1. We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like 
to
discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of 
our insights to the consultant.
In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the 
details and in the inputs and
calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results 
depending
on the quality of inputs. 

2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We 
were told that you
would provide an IT resource. Alex would supervise this person.

Hello Shmuel,

Thanks for your message. The end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001 were 
extremely busy 
and I could not focus on PSERC issues. I shall consult a few people in Enron 
on this subject and get in
touch with you. Our concern right now is that the results of research are 
widely shared with
our competition.

I am out on the 19th, but the 20th would work for me. I would be glad to 
cover the cost of your Austin
to Houston trip.

Regarding your son. The Analyst / Associate program will interview again on 
the campus
in the spring and they will be more than happy to interview him.

Subject: Fw: PSERC nuggets related to market Stem


Hello Vince
Happy Holidays.
I wanted to connect with you regarding the possibility of Enron Joining
PSERC. As you might have heard from Lance and Alex we are going through a
transition period having doubled the number of universities and industry
members within the last year. Consequently, our business processes are not
well developed. One of the problems we are facing is the balance between the
electrical engineering folks and industry members that are more interested
in market related research. I hope to recruit more of the later so tat we
have more of a constituency in the Advisory Board  that sees the value of
market related research. I already have a verbal commitment from people at
Electrabell that expressed interest in joining PSERC. With members like
Electrabell and Enron we will be able to support more market Stem projects
such as the one that Shijie Deng proposed (not funded in this round). Please
let me know if I can do anything to facilitate the decision at Enron. I am
going to be in Austin on January 19 to participate at a PUCT hearing and
could come through Huston for a visit. Attached are some items that I shared
with our PSERC members and thought that you might be interested in them as
well.
Regards, Shmuel.

Subject: Possible hire?



Dear Vince,

A faculty member in our department, namely Dr. Keith Baggerly,
 is interested in pursuing other employment. He is currently an
assistant professor in our program and a highly valued member  of
our department. We hate to lose him, however his interest has shifted
from the academic arena to one of high level but practical application
and development of statistical methodologies including
stochastic modeling.

Keith is actually a graduate of our Ph.D. program; he was in the same
group of students as Martin Lawera. Keith spent several years at Los
Alamos National Lab before we recruited him back to Rice. He has
been on our faculty now for three years and it is my expectation
(and that of my colleagues) that if he remained he would receive
tenure.

Keith has a strong interest in financial models and the background
to support his interest. He is also a leading expert in statistical
computing, empirical likelihood, categorical models and areas
of statistics falling under the general bailiwick of ""data mining"".
He is a creative thinker.

I do not know if there are possibilities for Keith within your group,
however
I believe it is an excellent match of talent and objectives.  Would you
have an interest in speaking with Keith? If so, I will suggest that he
contact you.

Best regards,

Kathy Ensor

samples of our chapters of the book too, in the next couple of days,  in
order to try and get one or two sentence ""reviews"" for the dust jacket of
the book. I obviously won't say anything about Enron's sponsorship until it
is official sorted out, but is it OK if I indicate that yourself and Grant
are contributing material to the book?

I'm proposing to send 5 or 6 chapters to the following - unless you have
any objections or suggestions?

David Shimko
Ehud Ronn
Helyette Geman
Mark Garman
Dragana Pilipovic
Corwin Joy
Ilia Bouchouev
Alexander Edyleland
Steve Thomas

Hope the writing is going OK, and regards to Grant.

Best regards.

Chris

P.S. I shall   take 3 vacation days  12/27 through 12/29 (Wed through Fri).
This leaves me with two extra vacation days I would like to take off in 
December.
I shall give you the dates later. 

I shall roll remaining 5 vacation  days into 2001.

Subject: MATLAB at Enron


Hello Vince :

I'm the Territory Manager for the MathWorks, we develop MATLAB technical
software. We've recently developed tools well suited for Energy Trading
Industry.

Enron has used our products in the past, but all of those end-users have
left Enron.

Risk Management and Research groups at Southern Energy, TXU, Dynegy, El
Paso Energy, Koch, Calpine, Reliant and others have recently started using
our products in the following ways.

1. Create sophisticated option pricing models, risk analysis models, and
stress analysis models. Creating GUI front ends for the end-users.
2. Pull in Data from ODBC, Corba, and SAS databases to evaluate.
3. Visualize the results and quantify the solution.
4. Compile these models and distribute these applications to their
Traders, Analysists and Managers with no distribution costs.

Who should I contact at your company to discuss Enron's situation to see if
our can help Enron as it has with our other Energy customers?


Thank you for your time and help.

Enron location makes more sense. No reason to pay for the hotel.
Also, I think that one day makes more sense.

I contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training

I have  left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally. My brother  Vikas, who is now in London, is trying to make a switch from consulting world to  working for a specific firm. Over last few months, I have heard of great deal  about the success of Enron on line business which fits well in the area of his  expertise. I am wondering if you know of some one in London who he can speak to  regarding career opportunities. 
 
Since  I spoke to you last, a number of things have changed. Recently, my manadate was  broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk management function  for both the domestic and international businesses for GMAC. Needless to say,  this is exciting albeit making the life a little more hectic than  usual.

Thank you, Vince. 
I understand this tax effect already when you explained it to me in your 
office this morning.
I agree with you that short-selling is not so good, especially for me, 
because I have 
a significant capital loss this year. I definitely don't want to increase my 
capital loss carry over.
(The short-selling idea might work for a person who wants to exercise his 
options and 
already has a huge capital gain this year. Unfortunately, it is not me.)
Thanks again for pointing this out.
The ""employee stock option with taxes"" problem sounds interesting. I will 
think more about it when I have free time.

Subject: Re: short-sell vs exercise  

Chonawee,

As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad 
decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).

Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option.
You  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares). The price goes to 
$100.  
You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise 
gives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxes
on your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is
28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss against
ordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes. 

Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option 
position
as an offset.

The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get the
tax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have 
income in the
future (or capital gains).

Not so good.

By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options
is a very interesting and difficult problem.

Subject: short-sell vs exercise

Below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere. It 
explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised 
but cannot be sold. (As we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call 
option before its maturity). However, after taking Vince's comments on the 
ordinary income/capital loss TAX offsetting issue, I think this is not a good 
article anymore. I guess I could just throw this article away. :-)
-chonawee


Short-selling is better than exercising your employee stock options

In general, the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when 
you speculate that ENE is going down or its growth rate is extremely low. In 
fact, when exercising the options, you are speculating that ENE would never 
reach this point (plus interest) again during the 10 years maturity date or 
until you leave the company. If you do not anticipate that, you should hold 
on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your 
exercise.

However, if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak. Then, instead of 
exercising the options, you should short-sell (or sell) the stocks in that 
amount. After short-selling, when you feel that the stock starts to go up, 
you can buy them back (to cover), make profit, and still keep the options. On 
the other hand, if the stock does not go down as expect, you can exercise the 
options to cover your short position anytime. 

Let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes, no dividends, 
and zero risk-free rate. Suppose that ENE follows a simple sample path as 
follow


If you exercise 100 ENE options with a grant price of 45 when ENE reaches 70, 
you would earn  (70-45)*100 = $2,500. But if you short sell 100 ENE at 70, no 
matter how much ENE is in the future, you can exercise the options to cover 
the short position and still earn (70-45)*100 = $2,500. The advantage of 
short-selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60. At this point, you can 
cover your short position, get (70-60)*100 = $1,000, and still keep your 
options or you can exercise the options and gain $2,500. That is, you still 
keep the flexibility of your options when you short-sell. In conclusion, the 
only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your 
short position.

I shall be very glad to talk to you about different approaches we can take (books ranging from

You can take a quick look at the book published by Risk magazine, ""Managing Energy

it will not be a problem to move him here at short notice.

Subject: RE: Thesis on Electricity Price Jump-Diffusions


Hi Vince,

Can you e-mail me your mailing address in Houston and I will send you a hard
copy of the above today.  Apologies for delay, but I wanted to ensure that
Les Clewlow had received his copy in Sydney before distributing any other
copies.

Incidentally, today (March 27th) is a red letter day in the UK as the NETA /
new electricity trading arrangements have gone 'live'.  Should be
interesting to observe the development of the paper market in the coming
months - you're no doubt aware that IPE have just launched an electricity
futures contract.

Regards

Bernard

Subject: Iris's trip to London

Vince:

Iris had asked if it was possible to get a room in London with a kitchenette 
so she could make some of her own meals since she is vegetarian .  The 
Anetheum has apartments with kitchens but they cost a $100 a day more than 
the regular room.   Should I just give her a regular room?    Sorry to bother 
you with all of this, but I don't know the appropriate thing to do in this 
case.

Vince - attached is the most recent E&P version of the old corporate cash 
flow model that I could find.  Note that ""most recent"" still dates it back a 
few years.  A couple caveats:  I did try to clean it up somewhat from old 
macros, but no guarntees offered.  Also, some of the underlying methodology 
is not what we would probably currently use, such as for pricing, stochastic 
processes, and perhaps decline rates.  
Please let me know if I can provide any additional help.

I met Maureen yesterday and had a useful discussion on her role within 
Enron.  I think it would be very helpful to promote the Research group 
function of the company, particularly given Maureen's background,  if she 
could be introduced to some of the main traders down at MG.  Unfortunately 
she won't have time to meet with MG unless we can schedule some meetings on

Would you be happy for her to extend her stay here till Monday to allow the

Subject: Off-site: John Griebling's organization and Research Group

Jeff,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
organization
and the Research Group. 

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are also inviting to this off-site senior management of EBS and plan to 
have
on the agenda several presentations about strategic directions of EBS. The 
effort
of network design and construction currently under way is  unprecedented in 
terms
of its scope and complexity and it is important  for technical people, who 
often have
highly specialized technical skills, to understand the broad picture.

I would appreciate if you could join us for Friday afternoon (April 28) and
Saturday (April 29). I understand  that you have commitments on Thursday and 
Friday 
morning. We have reorganized the tentative agenda of the meeting to devote
Friday afternoon to more general topics.

Vince

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to 
have 
you as a keynote speaker. 

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about the program and  I think that this will be 
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
agenda for the future.

I talked to Vasant about the model review in London. He thought that he could 
accomplish this from Houston,
but I think direct  communication makes things much easier. I think his trip 
to London
makes a lot of sense. KMV confirmed the meeting on the 20th. We hope to get 
more information about
the scope of their model and assess its the applicability to your business.
Vasant, after a few days of immersion in your operations, will be able to 
assess better the usefulness of the
model.

Vince,

Thanks for forwarding the resume.  We have generally had great success with 
ex-Koch people.
He sounds might like he may be a good fit for Michael L. Miller in principal 
investments.  At this point
I have very recently inherited two other stron VPs from EI and therefore will 
probably focus on a few
Manager and Associates for the near term but I would like to keep James' 
resume for further opportunities.
He sounds like someone we should at least meet with and figure out a spot 
within Wholesale Services.
What do you think?

Regards,

-Larry-

Subject: EBS Research Telecom Rercruiting Effot

Hi, Vince please put your best effort in making sure that we differentiate 
summer interns and associates that EBS Research will be hiring.  I am talking 
about compensation here.  Ken Rice mentioned that EBS is in the process of 
developing a technical equivalent of our AA pool. EBS research people can 
potentially rotate through this pool in the future.  I just don't want to 
risk losing people like Giuseppe (& get the word out that we are low-ballers) 
because we have to fit them into certain set of categories that was designed 
for the energy business.  I realize that you have estabilished such 
differentiation for research as a whole, but I think that would have to be 
moved up a notch in the case of EBS.

Ravi.

The enclosed is from another of the people in the audience of my Kao

research he does would be free.  He's looking for direction.  I doubt we 
would want to waste our time and effort on him, but I thought I should send

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

My name is Eric Takigawa of Algorithmics Japan, and I spoke with you on the
last day of the seminar.

I would be pleased to receive a copy of your presentation with the promise
of non-circulating the material.

I have been in communication with Mr. Jonath Whitehead and will be meeting
Mr. Joe Hirl in early August.  You mentioned another individual at Enron
Japan - Antonio Dai(?) but couldn't recall the proper spelling of his name
and would like the opportunity to meet with him.

There is a tremendous opportunity for Enron in Japan and the conditions are
just right.

Kind regards,

Eric

Perfect.  Thanks, Vince.

In all likelihood, it would be just fine, it is just not customary for job
talks to include others.  Again, since you are a member of the Risk
Management Chair Search Committee (you may not know of this official
capacity, but I believe it is the case), we by all means hope that you will
be able to attend the seminar as well as dinner.

I will get details on the schedules to you early next week.

I can pick up the cost of your trip from the Research Group budget.

The more I think about  it, the more I am convinced it would be difficult 
to justify 2 trips per person. I think that we should go for one contiguous 
stay per person and make a good
effort to make these trips productive.

Subject: Summer visits  

Vince

Thanks for offering to look my presentation over.  The deadline for 
submission has been extended until tomorrow (Friday), so there's less of a 
hurry.

As regard our summer visits, we'll need to speak to Dale over the budget.  
Personal commitments mean it's difficult for me to take two whole months to 
visit, so if the cost is prohibitive I may need to make just one shorter 
visit.  I'd obviously like to spend longer, and two visits seems to be the 
only way I can do it.  I believe the situation is similar for Kirstee.

I've persuaded Richard to pay for Matt's visit in its entirety, and I've no 
doubt that RAC/Credit Trading will pick up the bills for Ben and Kirstee.  
It's difficult to think who'd be the natural group to pay for me.  I honestly 
think I'll have difficulty persuading, e.g. Richard, that it's worth his 
while to pay for my visit.  I get the impression he thinks I'm doing OK 
without the need to go to Houston for further training.

I'm interviewing a candidate for Bjorn's model review role during today's 
videoconference, so we'll need to speak beforehand or perhaps Friday.

All the best,
Steve

I was under the impression I sent you a message regarding Brad Romine but
I cannot find a copy in my msg folder. There might have been a glitch in the 
CC-mail
and the message did not go through and wasn't  stored.

I wanted to make the following points:

1. Brad will not show up on March 15. He is still working on his dot-com 
business and wants to
pursue this opportunity.

2. My recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand. Either Brad 
or a stipend
refund check should show up on March 15.

3. I told Brad that  a failure to show up on March 15 will not imperil his 
future employment opportunities
with Enron. We just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource 
needs. If he decides to re-apply
at some point in the future, we shall not hold his  decision  to pursue him 
entrepreneurial plans against him.

Please, let me  know what you think.

Hi Vince,

It was a pleasure meeting you during your visit to London.  I hope that all 
is well with you.  Steve, Sharad, Slava and myself sat down today with my PhD 
supervisor to more or less concrete what my thesis will be based on.  To 
start off, I will be working on a price process for power that is tied to the 
stack model.  I imagine that later on we will be pricing power derivatives 
off of this or modifications of it.  Steve has recommended a good paper  - 
""Pricing Power Derivatives"" by Geman and Eydeland.  I will be implementing 
their model as that would be a very good departure for me and might also 
prove to be useful to Enron.  The only unfortunate thing is that we are 
unable to locate the paper.  With this in mind, I thought that you might have 
a copy readily available.  Steve and I will continue to look but any 
assistance would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance and take care.

Best regards,

Marcus

The best speaker for the occasion you have in mind is Steve Kean, EVP CHIEF OF STAFF, (713) 853-1586
EB 4712 , steve.kean@enron.com .

I shall leave a phone message for Steve about the invitation from you. Can you indicate the subject
of the presentation, or would you like to leave it to him to decide?

As you have correctly pointed out, the model validation issues cannot

The problem is that everybody is swamped right now with
PRCs and end-of-year issues.

I don't think we shall send our  full  VaR model under any circumstances.
We can offer to sell a reduced version based on RiskMetrics.

By the way, our meeting Tuesday will start at 11:00  a.m., Houston time.

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

I read with interest your company=01,s description on the
Web page. I was highly impressed by the work that
ENRON Corporation does and would like to inquire about
employment opportunities with your company.

Enclosed is a copy of my resume that details my
academic qualifications and practical experience. I am
excited about stepping into a position, which will
utilize my technical, analytical, and interpersonal
skills in a fast paced environment, and look forward
to expanding my horizons with new challenges and
opportunities that ENRON Corporation   will offer. I
know from customer and supervisor feedback that I have
the interpersonal skills imperative to building a
successful career at the ENRON Corporation and am
motivated to do so. Your firm has an excellent
reputation and I genuinely look forward to becoming a
part of the ENRON Corporation community.

I know you must be busy during this time of the year,
but I would sincerely appreciate a few minutes of your
time. I plan to call you within the next seven days to
discuss how my education, practical skills, and
background would qualify me as a member of your
company. In the meantime, if you need to contact me,
my daytime and nighttime number is (512) 474-6683 and
my e-mail address is knirel@mail.utexas.edu.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I
look forward to talking to you.

Sincerely,

Nina Knirel

Steve,

I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather
negative: he seems to be a consultant type person
who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth
and technical details.

He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive
side.

Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after
18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.

Subject: Interview

Hi Vince,

what did you think of David Hsu?

My thoughts.

Overall a good guy. Personable. Intelligent.

He could communicate reasonably well, but seemed to be capable of losing 
objectivity in favour of technical advancement.

He didn't seem comfortable with taking a man-management role (at least he 
didn't want to be an 'administrator')

He appeared to know a lot about risk. (In fact Jay Web called me to say he 
felt David was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented 
that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull).

regards

Steve

Thanks for the invitation to speak on October 23rd.

Would you like me to split my presentation and devote
some time to the Enron Analyst/Associate program?

I plan to make presentation on   energy derivatives markets
(development of the markets in the US and Europe, valuation
challenges, Enron's role in developing the forward markets for natural gas 
and electricity).
I shall send you the bullet points in a few days.

Vince,

Greetings!  I am the director of the MS in Computational Finance program at
Carnegie Mellon.  I am following up on a conversation I had with Kevin
Kindall, a graduate of our program, who gave me your e-mail address and
suggested I contact you as the individual making the recruiting decisions
for the Research Group at Enron.

In speaking with the director of the Career Opportunity Center at the
business school, I am told that although an Alison Bailey from Enron
(mary.alison.bailey@enron.com) has arranged for a sizable block of rooms in
which to conduct interviews on campus on December 11th, there is as yet no
indication of whether the Comp Finance students will have opportunity to
compete for these spaces.

We are regarded by many in the industry as the top quantitative finance
program in the country.  Focused on derivative pricing, econometrics, VAR
and portfolio management, our graduates should be an excellent fit for your
business.  I would be happy to talk with you further about our
rogram( http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/) as well as our students' interest
in Enron (the name comes up a lot!).  Also, if you are interested, we run a
""Speaker Series""  on most Friday's during the fall and spring that would
give you (or another in your group) the opportunity to address our students
in an area of interest.  Such a meeting would, I think, help you better
understand the careers our students are preparing to pursue as well as give
our students first hand knowledge of Enron and its future.

When might be a good time to contact you by telephone?

Thank you for your time.

Jeff,

I would like to get on your calendar (together with Jeff Shankman) for 15 - 
30 minutes
to discuss the results of my visit at the Wharton School with Tom Piazze.
A separate message about  this visit will follow.

I would like also to talk to you  about the way we manage our relationships 
with
different universities. Historically, we were rather passive customers of
the academic institutions, trying to hire the best students and limiting our 
presence
on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions.

We should rethink the way we work  with universities. The efforts to get 
the best students look more and more like a hand-to-hand combat and often we 
are not
very successful. It is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses
and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways:

1. Involvement in research projects. For  example, we are currently  
underwriting two research
projects at Stanford University, involving  Ph.D. students of Professor  
Nicholas Bambos
(a top expert on communications networks). We shall participate in formulation
of the projects' objectives and will be given access to the results.
Involvement in research projects allows us to obtain 
access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and 
also to lock-up some very
promising students. Most companies in the high tech industries have such 
programs.

2. Lectures and presentations by Enron employees. Practically every 
presentation
I have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes 
and hiring decisions.
It is important that students get exposed to Enron early in their academic 
program. In many cases,
the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach 
them during their 
senior years.

3. Visits by faculty members in Enron. 

Closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to 
getting the best students
and obtaining access to current research. The universities are very important 
in shaping public  opinion
on the issues critical to Enron's future (especially in the area of 
deregulation and design of new markets).

Currently, the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on 
personal commitment of a number
of overworked Enron employees. In many cases, there is no continuity and 
focus.

I want to recommend a creation of a special function (VP or MD level) 
responsible for coordinating
our relationships with the universities. This function would be separate from 
our Analyst/Associate
program. I have many ideas how this function could be structured.

Vince,

We had spoken a few weeks back, but were unable to meet due to our 
schedules.  I will be back in Houston next week (August 21st), and would 
appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and take your advice. 

As I may have mentioned to you, I am interested in exploring opportunities 
that are more US focused.  I think Paula Corey has already forwarded my 
resume to you.  However, I have attached it to this note just in case.  



I would really appreciate the opportunity to meet with you next week, and 
would be grateful if you could let me know what time fits best with your 
schedule.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,



Rahul

Subject: Your Encouragement Would Be Appreciated

The Gas and Power Trading organizations have had a tremendous year.  
Sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization 
that significantly contributed to that success.  I believe the Weather Group 
comprised of Mike Robert's, Jose Marquez, Stephen Bennett and Dave Ryan from 
Power are one of those groups.  These individuals have done a tremendous job 
of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take.  The 
greatest achievement has been the November and December winter forecast.  
They held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were 
moderating.  On a score card with all other services they definitely deserve 
an ""A+"".  When you are down on the 32nd floor it would be nice if you would 
stop and congratulate them on a tremendous job and their contribution to our 
success.

 Thanks,  Jim Schwieger

Hi Kim,

I don't see any problem. For the time being, he can keep his desk on the 19th 
floor as
well ( and the same phone number). It will be helpful when he has to work 
closely with Krishna
under time constraint.

At some point, as we hire more people and run out of space, we can move him 
completely to

Please, ask your assistant to call Shirley and arrange the move.

Hi Vince!  

I hope you and a nice Christmas and New Year!  It's nice to be back and in 
the full swing of the new year.  

I have a question for you.  I spoke with Krishna prior to him leaving for 
India about the possibility of moving Youyi up to our floor so that we can 
work closer with him.  Krishna thought that this would be a good idea.   It 
would be great to have Youyi with us soon so that he will be intimately 
involved with the whole approach of our prototype model.  Although Krishna 
will be back at the end of the month, would you mind if I speak with Youyi 
and begin the paperwork for moving him onto our floor?  I'm not sure if 
Krishna has mentioned this to Youyi yet.  I did not want to surprise anyone 
and wanted to run this by you or Krishna for final approval.  

Many thanks, Kim.

John,

I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research 
Group,
is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of 
talent we have currently
in London.
Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time
to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.


My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader, 
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy 
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.

His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value 
technical
skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the 
same caliber
as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to 
Houston
for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a 
sufficient
incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has 
greatly improved.

Please, let me know what you think.

I am sending you a draft of the outline  of the course on energy derivatives.

This is a resume I received today from  my friend.
Please, take a look at it. What follows below is a copy of his message to
me:


Dear Vincent,

I very much would like to ask you for a career advice. I am looking for new
challenges and new professional opportunities. Possibly there would be such
opportunity around yourself  at Enron Corporation.

I trust that my strongest asset is my intellectual capital and ability to
look from new angles into complex issues. Beside of the experience of
working under Jacob Goldfield an Paul Jacobson at Goldman on the interest
rate swaps and proprietary desks, I was a part of research effort of John
Meriwether group at Salomon Brothers, I headed the European interest options
desk at DKBI in London and I have managed a small hedge fund in partnership
with Albert Friedberg.

 I hold Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT and I have studied under Nobel
Laureate in Economics, Bob Merton.

I very much would like to apply my knowledge of capital markets, trading and
research in the field of energy markets.

With my very best regards and personal wishes,

Just an update for you and a question.  First, I have talked to Christie
and corresponded via e-mail.  We don't have dates to talk to Lay, Skilling
and Fastow as yet but Christie is working on it.  I will prompt her again
next week.

The second item of business is a question.  I want to see if we can move
our meeting in Spring (Business education and the new economy workshop)
back a week to Friday February 23rd.  One of the attendees has a conference
he wants to attend on March 2nd.  Let me know asap if the 23rd works for
you.  I have committments from a number of folks for the workshop and I
think it will be great fun and a wonderful learning experience for us all.

Subject: exploration data as the root of the energy (oil) supply chain and 
consulting

Good Morning Vince:

1) We met with some geophysical data gathering/transmission people last 
week.  I observed that there is an opportunity to get in the early steps of 
the (oil exploration) energy supply chain - we can get at the key data 
driving oil drilling earlier than anyone else by extending into this area of 
broadband networking - to build a way to hedge oil and other energy trades.  

I asked Adler or Reichardt to present the idea to your team for validation.  
Have they contacted you yet?

2) I'm converting to consultant - I've had a great year here but need to get 
back north more often (family).  I will be converting to consultant status 
starting next week.  Do not hesitate to call me if there is anything I can do 
for you or your team to help out.

RiskBrief issue 4
From FinanceWise: the only dedicated financial search engine
============================================================
22 March 2000

Dear RiskBrief subscribers

The fourth edition is here, and this month's theme is weather.
Weather derivatives is increasingly a hot topic on the web at the
moment. Four sites have been launched in the last three months,
including tradeweather.com, weather-risk.com and WeatherRiskAdvisory.com.
Along with the weather trading site from Liffe (I-WeX.com),
launched in January, and the introduction last September of
weather futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), there is
something of a rush on.

To provide you with an online resource to weather risk, we have
an introductory guide, two site reviews, 22 articles and an
exclusive book offer.

http://www.tradeweather.com (see site reviews)
http://www.weather-risk.com (see site reviews)
http://www.WeatherRiskAdvisory.com
http://www.i-wex.com
http://www.cme.com/news/weather921.html

How fast will the weather derivatives market grow? Will there be
enough liquidity? Let us know what you think.

In the meantime, please enjoy the rest of this month's issue,
with 14 articles on currency trading, e-trading, and news of conferences,
jobs and more.

Regards

Rob Minto
Producer, FinanceWise

Subject: Rollover of my vacation days to 2001

Vince:
 I would like to rollover my vacation days for 2000 remaining at the end of 
this year to 2001. I could not use us all of my available vacation this year 
because of the following reasons:

1. As you know, I have been supporting three business units (EES, EPG & Enron 
India) this year. All these units had difficult and relatively long projects 
that required experience in energy markets, derivatives pricing and business 
knowledge that I had gained over the last few years at Enron.

2. There has been a significant change in the team members reporting to me. I 
now have six people under me compared to only three at the begin of the year. 
Of the current six members, five joined us only this year and most of them 
didn't have any prior work experience, thus requiring a lot of my time in 
recruiting, training and mentoring.

3. Given that I had to visit our Bombay office in January, 2000 for a 
business trip (10 days) and will need to go there again in January, 2001, I 
could not take leave from my work for the other two units (EES & EPG) for an 
extended period of time.

So, in summary, this year has been a long and challenging one, and as a 
result, I could not take vacation for more than a few days. I request you to 
grant the rollover of my remaining vacation to next year. 

Currently I have 136 hours of vacation available and , of these, I expect to 
have 112 hours unused at the end of this year.

Thank you,
Krishna.

John,

This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.

1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH 
and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the 
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island 
project (please, see point 2).

2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest 
(Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island 
transaction. The next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is 
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.

A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:

a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island 
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term
contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.

The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the 
long-term
contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are 
setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal 
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and 
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.

b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension 
option of
5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we
have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for 
such a long tenor. This is  
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread 
and
I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.

One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the 
first
5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.

c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a 
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market.

d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island 
deal
(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.
Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail 
that 
correlates very well with Brent.

I haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  
Anyway with Greg moving to his
new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the 
Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.

I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for 
LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand
that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far 
away).  Anway I understand this
is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you 
please let me know where you stand now?

I will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in

I have approached a number of executives at Enron. Greg Whalley speaks in

Subject: Economic Espionage Act Presentation - August 15th


You are cordially invited to attend a presentation entitled:  ""Acquiring 
Information: Trade Secrets and the Economic Espionage Act (EEA)"".   Daniel 
Waltz, of the law firm Patton Boggs LLP, is a leading expert on the EEA and 
will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment.  
Congress passed the EEA in 1996, and it will increasingly shape how corporate 
America collects, uses, and protects valued information.  In addition to 
explaining some of the intricacies of the EEA, Dan Waltz will include 
""hypothetical"" corporate case studies (some actually torn from the headlines) 
to illustrate his points.

This event is sponsored by ENA's Competitive Analysis and Business Controls 
(CABC) group and is supported by ENA legal.   This event kicks-off CABC's 
Competitive Intelligence Standards Program, which seeks to raise awareness of 
issues relevant both to Enron's practitioners and senior consumers of 
competitive intelligence.  This particular speaking engagement is designed to 
raise awareness of the EEA's legal guidelines, as well as to stimulate 
thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well 
as how we might better protect Enron's own proprietary information.   I 
believe the topic of the EEA is especially relevant, given that we find 
ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age.  

All CABC staff is being asked to attend this presentation, and we are 
inviting a small number of other Enron employees who are engaged in aspects 
of serious competitive intelligence.  Select executives like yourselves are 
being invited to attend, and I would welcome any suggestions of others that 
you think might benefit from attending this event.  

The EEA presentation is set for August 15, 1:30-3:00 PM, in the 50th floor 
Conference room.  Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell.  Hope to 
see you there.


 
P.S.  By the way, our next speaker segment in the CI Standards Program will 
concentrate on the guidelines and implications of the ""Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act (FCPA),"" and will likely be scheduled for the fall.

Vince,

We just wanted to let you know that we only have 3 people signed up for the  
weather derivatives course (all from Enron) so far.? We have a couple more  
that have expressed strong interest, but we are awaiting their final  
decision.? If no one else signs up, Chris and Les thought that you guys  
could probably get through the first day pretty easily,?and thus thought it  
may be an option to teach just the 2nd day material (pricing) only at Enron  
(doing it at the Hyatt is an option as well but the room might be on the 
large  side)?? We would obviously reimburse you for the day not taught.? We  
can teach both days as well, but thought you may want to save some time.?  
?
I just wanted to give you some time to think about it.? We will know  where 
we stand on final numbers by next Wednesday.

2.  Your AV requirements, if any.  Should you need either, we have an
overhead projector as well as laptop capability (either YOUR laptop, or we
can with advance notice reserve a laptop if you bring floppies).

BTW, any developments re Jeff Skilling's 2/22 conference keynote?

Vince,
Just wanted to follow up on our conversation yesterday regarding Kin Tso.  
Charlene actually called Kin yesterday to let him know that your group was 
interested in him as a direct hire and would be contacting him this week.  As 
we discussed, Kin was told that his quantitative skills were a much better 
fit for your group instead of our rotating Associate program.  We let him 
know that the Associate program would not be making him an offer but he is 
being considered for a direct hire.  Kin was receptive and is looking forward 
to hearing from you.  We will consider this issue closed from the Associate 
and Analyst Program.  We hope that you might find a direct hire fit for him 
in your area.  If you have any additional questions, please let me know.  
Thanks so much.

Vince,
I must apologize to you about the version of the paper i sent last evening.
i was pretty exhausted from the day and didn't stop to give it a proof
reading (on paper). I still find that screen editing is a poor substitute
for holding the paper and marking it up.
There is still work to be done but I think the paper is improving with each
iteration. I want to work more on documenting the specific ""events leading
up to the formation of the new unregulated business"" including some
documentation on the deregulation process and events in the natural gas
market. Specifically, I remember conversations about ""take or pay"" contract
defaults, etc. and the financial crisis they created. Also, Gene Humphries
commented in a round table discussion that Sheridan held at UT that Carl
Ichan made a play for Enron and this was fended off with a leveraged ESOP.
I would like to get all the details to these issues to better ""set up the
section on marching to the beat of a new drummer"".
I hope this process isn't too frustrating for you. I am convinced that we
will winnow out the story in the end if we persevere.
Have a great weekend.

We called Tom Limpers and talked about the services his company can offer to
Enron. It seems that they don't have any great product sitting on the shelf. It's rather
a group of university professors who are ready to offer their brain power to solve different
problems of interest to potential customers. 

We talked about different potential projects and suggested in what ways they could
demonstrate their problem solving skills before we go into more detailed discussions.

They promised to get back to us in a few days.

I don't know if you noticed that we have Tim Bollerslev on the seminar
schedule for December 8.  In order for Tim to get back to North Carolina on
Friday, we need to move the seminar time.  I thought that the Enron folks
might be interested in his talk so I wanted to get you input on a new

or would 2:00 be better?

<br>
<article><P>La soci&#233;t&#233; Intel a lanc&#233; la commercialisation, mardi 29 mai, de l&#39;Itanium, premier-n&#233; d&#39;une nouvelle g&#233;n&#233;ration de processeurs. Bas&#233;e sur une architecture 64 bits, la nouvelle puce du g&#233;ant am&#233;ricain du semi-conducteur pourra traiter des "" paquets "" d&#39;informations deux fois plus longs que ceux trait&#233;s par les processeurs &#233;quipant aujourd&#39;hui l&#39;&#233;crasante majorit&#233; des stations de travail et des serveurs Web. Une caract&#233;ristique qui permet de doubler la vitesse de traitement des donn&#233;es. Coupl&#233;e &#224; une vitesse d&#39;horloge de 733 &#224; 800 m&#233;gahertz &#8211; selon les versions &#8211;, cette caract&#233;ristique permettra &#224; l&#39;Itanium d&#39;ex&#233;cuter plusieurs milliards d&#39;op&#233;rations par seconde.</p>

<P>Outre la vitesse d&#39;horloge du processeur et l&#39;architecture de sa nouvelle puce, Intel met &#233;galement en avant l&#39;utilisation de la technologie dite du "" parall&#233;lisme explicite "" (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing, ou EPIC), mise au point en partenariat avec Hewlett-Packard et intimement li&#233;e &#224; la nouvelle architecture de l&#39;Itanium. Cette technologie permet au compilateur de traiter les informations entrantes de fa&#231;on parall&#232;le. Il est ainsi capable de les relayer en fonction de leur nature, simultan&#233;ment. A la cl&#233; : le processeur &#233;vite ainsi les goulets d&#39;&#233;tranglement &#224; l&#39;entr&#233;e des processeurs classiques. La puce peut ainsi travailler plus vite.</p>

<P>Pourquoi une telle surench&#232;re ? Pour permettre, entre autres, de meilleurs temps de r&#233;ponse aux sites fortement sollicit&#233;s, mais &#233;galement prendre en charge des protocoles cryptographiques de plus en plus lourds. Mais il peut s&#39;agir &#233;galement d&#39;optimiser les activit&#233;s de data mining &#8211; l&#39;extraction d&#39;informations cibl&#233;es &#8211; qui s&#39;op&#232;rent dans des bases de donn&#233;es toujours plus lourdes.</p>

<P>Comme toute chose dans l&#39;univers de l&#39;informatique, l&#39;arriv&#233;e de l&#39;Itanium ne se fera pas sans vagues et devrait engendrer une cascade d&#39;&#233;piph&#233;nom&#232;nes. D&#39;ores et d&#233;j&#224;, Intel affirme avoir re&#231;u le soutien d&#39;une trentaine de fabricants &#8211; dont Compaq, Unisys, Dell, IBM, etc. &#8211; qui devraient proposer l&#39;Itanium sur les prochaines versions de leurs serveurs. Outre l&#39;arriv&#233;e &#8211; pr&#233;vue d&#232;s cet &#233;t&#233; &#8211; des premi&#232;res machines &#233;quip&#233;es de la nouvelle cr&#233;ature d&#39;Intel, les fabricants de logiciels et les d&#233;veloppeurs d&#39;applications devront s&#39;adapter. Premier concern&#233;, Microsoft devra refondre ses syst&#232;mes d&#39;exploitation en fonction de l&#39;architecture 64 bits de l&#39;Itanium, pour tirer r&#233;ellement parti de ces nouvelles performances.</p>

<P>La conception du dernier-n&#233; d&#39;Intel ne s&#39;est pas faite sans douleur. D&#232;s 1996, la soci&#233;t&#233; avait annonc&#233; son intention de mettre au point cette nouvelle g&#233;n&#233;ration de processeurs. Le d&#233;but de la fabrication de "" Merced "" &#8211; premier nom de code de la puce &#8211; avait ainsi &#233;t&#233; annonc&#233;e pour 1999, puis report&#233;e &#224; mi-2000, pour finalement &#234;tre lanc&#233; aujourd&#39;hui. La raison de ces retards successifs est principalement due aux difficult&#233;s rencontr&#233;es par les ing&#233;nieurs d&#39;Intel pour accro&#238;tre le caden&#231;age de la puce. En 1997, la firme am&#233;ricaine avait ainsi communiqu&#233; sur une fr&#233;quence de fonctionnement avoisinant les 900 m&#233;gahertz. Le pari, sur ce point, n&#39;a pas &#233;t&#233; tenu.</p>

<P>Mais les obstacles techniques rencontr&#233;s par les ing&#233;nieurs d&#39;Intel n&#39;ont pas &#233;t&#233; mieux v&#233;cus par ceux d&#39;AMD. Le concurrent d&#39;Intel avait ainsi annonc&#233; la sortie de son processeur &#224; 64 bits pour cette ann&#233;e et a &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; contraint de reporter son lancement. Mais la riposte &#224; la sortie de l&#39;Itanium ne s&#39;est pas fait attendre. AMD a ainsi annonc&#233;, trois jours avant le lancement de la puce d&#39;Intel, la mise en place d&#39;une collaboration avec Transmeta pour <EM>"" mettre au point les standards de demain dans le domaine des microprocesseurs "". </EM>Il s&#39;agit, bien s&#251;r, du lancement d&#39;un concurrent direct &#224; l&#39;Itanium. Et, preuve que la cadence de ce rival annonc&#233; est &#233;galement probl&#233;matique, AMD et Transmeta se sont bien gard&#233;s d&#39;annoncer sa fr&#233;quence de fonctionnement.</p>

Taking summer interns is the best way to screen and identify good candidates

Preface

?

One of our main objectives in  writing Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk=
=20
Management has been to bring  together as many of the various approaches fo=
r=20
the pricing and risk management  energy derivatives as possible, to discuss=
=20
in-depth the models, and to show how  they relate to each other.? In this =
=20
way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models, price a wid=
e =20
range of energy derivatives, or to build a risk management system which use=
s=20
a  consistent modelling framework.? We  believe that for practitioners this=
=20
last point is very important and we continue  to stress in our articles and=
=20
presentations the dangers of having flawed risk  management and giving=20
arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using  ad-hoc and inconsiste=
nt=20
models for different instruments and markets (see also OTHERS WHO PROPOSE=
=20
CONSISTENT  MODELS?).? However, it is not  our wish to concentrate on one=
=20
particular model or models, at the exclusion of  the others because we=20
believe that the choice should rest with the user  (although it will probab=
ly=20
be clear from our discussions the model(s) we  prefer).? We therefore try a=
nd=20
give  as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of al=
l=20
the  models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models=
=20
which  best suit their needs.

?

In order to meet our objectives the  book is divided into 11 chapters.?  In=
=20
chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to  mode=
l=20
and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the  book=
.?=20
In addition to introducing  the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes=
=20
modelling framework we outline  the numerical techniques of trinomial trees=
=20
and Monte Carlo simulation for  derivative pricing, which are used througho=
ut=20
the book.

?

In Chapter 2 we discuss the  analysis of spot energy prices.? As  well as=
=20
analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes  that=
=20
can be used to model the prices.?  We look at the well-know process of=20
Geometric Brownian Motion as well as  mean reversion, stochastic volatility=
=20
and jump processes, discussing each and  showing how they can be simulated=
=20
and their parameters estimated.

?

Chapter 3, written by Vince  Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of=20
Enron Corp., discusses volatility  estimation in energy commodity markets.?=
 =20
This chapter builds on the previous one.? It examines in detail the methods=
, =20
merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different=
 =20
pricing models introduced in chapter 2.?  Examples from crude, gas, and=20
electricity markets are used to illustrate  the technical and interpretativ=
e=20
aspects of calculating volatility.

?

Chapter 4 examines forward curves  in the energy markets.? Although  such=
=20
curves are well understood and straight-forward in the most financial =20
markets, the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less wel=
l =20
defined curves.? In this chapter we  describe forward price bounds for ener=
gy=20
prices and the building of forward  curves from market instruments.? We =20
outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building=20
forward  curves in energy markets; the arbitrage approach, the econometric=
=20
approach, and  deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochasti=
c=20
factors.

?

Chapter 5 presents an overview of  structures found in the energy derivativ=
e=20
markets and discusses their uses.? Examples of products analysed in this =
=20
chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as=20
energy  swaptions, compound options, Asian options, barrier options, lookba=
ck=20
options,  and ladder options.

?

Chapter 6 investigates single and  multi-factor models of the energy spot=
=20
price and the pricing of some standard  energy derivatives.? Closed form =
=20
solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option=20
prices  both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the=
=20
models in  this chapter including a three factor, stochastic convenience=20
yield and interest  rate model.

?

Chapter 7 shows how the prices of  path dependent and American style option=
s=20
can be evaluated for the models in  Chapter 6.? Simulation schemes are =20
developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a=20
variety  of path dependent options.? In order  to price options which=20
incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial  tree scheme is=20
developed.? This tree  is built to be consistent with the observed forward=
=20
curve and can be used to  price exotic as well as standard European and=20
American style options.

?

Chapter 8 describes a methodology  for valuing energy options based on=20
modelling the whole of the market observed  forward curve.? The approach=20
results  in a multi-factor model that is able to realistically capture the=
=20
evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves.?  The user defined=20
volatility structures can be of an extremely general  form.? Closed-form=20
solutions are  developed for pricing standard European options, and efficie=
nt=20
Monte Carlo  schemes are presented for pricing exotic options.? The chapter=
=20
closes with a discussion of  the valuation of American style options.

?

Chapter 9 focuses on the risk  management of energy derivative positions.? =
=20
In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions =
=20
that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the=20
problem  of managing the risk through time.?  We begin with delta hedging a=
=20
portfolio containing derivatives and look  at extensions to gamma hedging =
=01)=20
illustrating the techniques using both spot and  forward curve models.? The=
=20
general  model presented in Chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi-factor=20
hedging of a  portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed.

?

Chapter 10 examines the key risk  management concept of Value at Risk (VaR)=
=20
applied to portfolios containing  energy derivative products.? After =20
discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs =20
(volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.? We then=
=20
compare the fours major  methodologies for computing VaR; Delta, Delta-gamm=
a,=20
historical simulation and  Monte-Carlo simulation, applying each to the sam=
e=20
portfolio of energy  options.? In this chapter we also  look at testing the=
=20
VaR estimates for various underlying energy market  variables.

?

Finally, in Chapter 11 we review  modelling approaches to credit risk.?  We=
=20
look in detail at two quite different approaches, CreditMetrics (J. P. Morg=
an=20
(1997)) and  CreditRisk+ (Credit Suisse Financial  Products (1997)) for whi=
ch=20
detailed information is publicly available.? Together these provide an=20
extensive set  of tools with which to measure credit risk.? We present=20
numerical examples of  applying these techniques to energy derivatives.

?
Before  we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this=
=20
book are tools  which should be used with the benefit of an understanding o=
f=20
how both the =01+tool=01,  and the market works.? The  techniques we descri=

Subject: Re: Summer Internship Position

Hi Vince, Paulo Oleira (one of the M.I.T attending our meeting on wed)'s 
research interest turned out to be a match for April Hodgeson (VP of content 
origination). I had him talk to April (Stinson was on the call as well) to 
discuss his research interest and what he would likely to do for April.  I 
suggested (and April agrees) that Paulo would intern with her and Matt and 
perform research on how end users (consumers and business) improved 
experience with ePowered content can be quantified.  This may include 
performing control experiments at M.I.T.  We decided not to over specify what 
he would do since it is likely to change as soon as he arrives.  I suggested 
once he starts, he will work with April and Matt Harris (VP enterprise 
origination) and they will define what the student needs to complete for the 
internship.  

Addiontionally, Tom Gros agrees that this type of research are needed and 
this is a great way to start.

I will proceed to have recruiting contact the student with an offer to start 
around May 22, 2000 unless someone tells me otherwise.

Regards,

Ravi.

P.S. Charlene, please include Paulo in your May 22, 2000 start group.  Paulo 
will report to me within EBS research group but will work on a day-to-day 
basis with April and Matt. As you've mentioned that compensation is somewhat 
fixed but please keep in mind that this person is a PhD candidate with very 
specialized skill set. Please contact Vince before extending an offer that 
may be too low, etc.

Subject: UK RAB Multiples

I talked with Keith Harris, our CFO at Wessex, about the RAB multiple graph I 
gave you.  He expressed that the Wessex people had originated the data and 
that the graph was correct, to the best of their knowledge.  The only (but 
very important correction) is that they started the graph at an index of 
100%, which does not imply a 100% of RAB multiple.  Rather, the initial RAB 
multiple was around 80%, implying that the entire line should be taken down 
by 20 percentile points.  Thus the all time hime in late 98 should be closer 
to the 1.3x RAB that I had targeted during our discussion.  Please call Keith

ATTN:  Lori Boutte

Hello all:

For your information, the Research Group (Co. # 0011, RC# 100038 - Vince
Kaminski, Managing Director) has purchased C++ Licenses for the following
individuals.

Ronnie Chahal
Stinson Gibner
James Gooding
Joe Hrgovcic
P. V. Krishnarao
Zimin Lu
Vasant Shanbhogue
Jason Sokolov
Vincent Tang
Ravi Thuraisingham
Pavel Zadorozhny

However, Ronnie Chahal, James Gooding, Jason Sokolov, Ravi Thuraisingham,
and Pavel Zadorozhny are no longer with the Research Group.  All but Jim
Gooding have transferred to other departments.  Jim Gooding has left the 
company.

Can we transfer Jim Gooding's license to Bob Lee (he just had C++ installed 
on 
his machine and a request for a license will probably be coming to you).

We could also keep the licenses that are issued to Ronnie, Jason, Ravi, and 
Pavel
for the Research Group's use.

Please let me know.

Thanks and have a great day!

I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
Enron Analyst/Associate program.

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
invited.

Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research in
particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).

My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
presentation
and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.

Subject: Support for Exotica

All

Sharad's investigations of Exotica's status in London have turned up a very 
confused state of affairs. This isn't being helped by the fact that:
1. Anjam is rarely at his desk, and can't be found anywhere in the building.
2. When he is around he isn't willing or able to provide all the information 
Sharad might need to support Exotica.  
This is worrying since much of our business depends on the validity of 
Exotica's valuations.

Sharad will now request information from Anjam via email to leave a trail, 
and I want to alert you to the fact that Sharad will be cc'ing you in on 
these emails.  

If things don't improve soon, I may need to request some assistance in 
extracting this information from Anjam.

Many thanks,
Steve

Subject: Equity investment Fair Value in Turkey

Vince,

John Sherriff recommended that I contact you regarding an interesting (and 
potentially contentious) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with 
in London.  We hold longish term options in a private company in Turkey which 
is currently seeking to IPO.  The issue we are discussing with RAC is which 
discount rate (i.e., risk-free? and if so Turkish or US?) should we use to 
value these options

First, some additional information.

Option characteristics:
-- 116,000 options (representing 9% of the company)
-- Term:  minimum of 3 years but possibly longer -- still being renegotiated
-- Strike price:  20% below the upcoming IPO price (either priced in US$ or 
Turkish Lire)

We currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $118.75 
per option but 34,800 expire on July 15, 2000 with the remainder expiring on 
December 15, 2000.  The company's investment bankers (ABN / AMRO Rothchilds) 
are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at 
$118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $300 million.  Due 
to such a large ""valuation gap"", they originally encouraged us to exercise 
all of the options by the end of June (IPO target date in late Sept / early 
Oct).  Our counter-proposal is to ""swap"" instrinsic value for time value by 
repricing the options strike higher while extending their term.

We are currently negotiating with RAC the most appropriate discount rate to 
use to value the options.  We are arguing that the US risk free is the most 
appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company's 
historical senior debt cost (18%) is the more appropriate number to use 
(although admit that this is not justifiable -- only a proxy)

A few key points:
-- RAC is valuing the options via Crystal Ball simulations such that this ""to 
be negotiated"" discount rate is used to calculate the PV of the future 
options intrinsic value in 3 years
 (i.e., for Black-Scholes, a higher discount rate yields a higher value but 
the opposite is true using Crystal Ball simulation)
-- The model simulates both an IPO / no IPO case and in the case of no IPO we 
have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17% return
-- The model assigns a 30% illiquidity discount
-- In the simulated cases where the options are out-of-the-money, we 
obviously do not exercise.

We understand that for Black-Scholes option valuation, one needs to be able 
to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and 
the risk free in order for the valuation to hold.  And here is where we reach 
our difficulty:  since the company doesn't currently trade on a public market 
and since equity futures do not exist for Turkish equities, RAC is arguing 
that a US risk free is not appropriate to use.  Our argument is that the 
non-IPO scenario, a 30% illiquidity discount and a US$ based option 
volatility are already in the factored into the simulation.  As such, we feel 
RAC's approach is double counting.

If you managed to get through the above, your a patient man!  I'll give you a 
call today or tomorrow after you've had a chance to digest the information.

Regards,
John Bottomley

CHARM looks more like  a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it 
more a
production tool.

We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM 
has)
in about two weeks, at request of Rick Jones who joined EES from HSB. Rick
worked on a similar model at his old company  and wanted to have a similar 
tool
for his projects with Enron. I can tell you more about it when we meet 
(hopefully) later
this week. 

I would tell Willis that the model requires more work before Enron can
consider it as commercial product.

Tani,
Please touch base with Lloyd Fleming as to whom from RAC should review the 
methodology.  I view that it is the commercial team's responsibility to post 
the curve, operations responsibility to gather objective information on the 
efficacy of the curve on a (minimum) monthly basis and report all highly 
sensitive curves, RAC will not approve or disapprove a curve but question 
methodology/motivations and subsequent changes and do so in a senior 
management forum (i.e., we will tell on those who have suspect curves or 
curve movements).  Obviously, we are looking for the best estimate of the 
value of those products in those time buckets TODAY, we also favor object, 
consistent application of methodoology intra and inter commodity.

Vince and Grant,

I have been made responsible for all gas and power curves in South America 
(plus books development, reporting, .......).  I have somewhat started but, 
since I am new on the job, I'd love to receive advice, guidance (and at some 
stage help) from you.  Would you be available for a meeting next week, 
preferably Thursday or Friday?   I'm planning to be in Houston these days.

I called Rick to let him know. It's not an interview  yet. Aram is coming for 
a
wedding but I think he wants to explore the opportunity of coming back
to Enron. The conversation may lead to an interview
at some point.

He will talk to Andrea as well.

Do you plan to organize something for Aram?
I would be glad to join.

Vince

Steve,

I shall call you tomorrow about it. My preference is to move Anjam to Houston
for some time. Anjam knows a lot about our business and specific positions
and it's better to prevent a potential leak. I have discussed this issue
with Dale and Richard  and  they concurred.

I don't  expect Anjam to act irrationally but it's better to be safe than 
sorry.

Subject: Contingencies

Hi Vince

If you're currently engaged in drawing up contingency plans for the Anjam 
situation, have you arranged for a ""snapshot"" of his computer directories to 
be taken?  We all tend to use our personal areas (on our H: drives) for 
development, and obviously there'll be a few years of work in Anjam's 
directories.  I wouldn't want him to wipe it all out in a fit of bad temper.  
Although our IT dept. obviously makes backups, I don't know how long they are 
kept for.

Cheers,
Steve

click on MiKTeX 2.0, and download all the highlighted zip files.  You may
also
want to download miktex-2.0-manual.pdf.
You can then unzip all the files and follow the steps outlined in

may not work. It's best to manually add the following to your path:

Hi Vince,

Sorry that we couldn't meet in Houston.  Hope your Philadelphia trip was
fruitful and you didn't suffer from weather related flight delays on your
way back to Houston.  Your phone message stated that you may be coming to NY
in Jan. 2001.  That's great & we should definitely plan to see each other in
NY, unless I come to Houston first.  I'd, however, appreciate a brief chat
today and pls call me if you schedule permits.

I'll be heading out to London tomorrow (mainly for the holidays) and won't
be back to the office until Thurs. 1/4, however, I'll be checking my phone-
and e-mail occasionally during the trip.

If today is not convenient, pls call me @ home tomorrow morning until
11:00am (NY time) and otherwise, pls offer another suitable time next week,
your tel. # , and I can call you from London.

Have a great and a very happy holiday season.

Soussan,

Use the ""Daily Activity"" worksheet in this file.  The CES storage balance as 
of 7/31/2000 is 4,053,932 dth (see balance in cell L146).  The actual sale to 
CES for the storage injections is deal 268094 - this deal shows the daily and 
monthly activity.

If I remember correctly, the only confusion we had on the TCO storage was the 
beginning balance.  There was 170,981 dth in storage on March 31st.  To 
correct for this, we adjusted the injections for April so that the balance on 
April 30th was 13%.

Let me know if you have questions.

Scott Goodell thinks this might be wholesale capacity for April and May.  
This is the first time I've heard about this.  I believe Joanie said this 
capacity is primary to Op 3 which doesn't do much for us.  

I need to know if we have to take this space.  I would prefer not to take the 
space if we don't have to.

Tallahassee called on the gas for the weekend.  I had planned for that in my numbers but I had no idea prices would go up $.07 - $.11 for the weekend - my fault.  This makes my cash balance at Reliant short by about $130.00 if prices post on the high side.  My trading contact at Reliant said that his credit department DOES NOT want to work with us at all.  My contact said his credit department could force him to cut the deal.  We won't know until this afternoon or Monday.  So please try to get the wire out today.

Hi everybody. It's Steve Cooper. It's Friday afternoon, March 1. I hope everybody has had a great week. I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week, so that you all will be fully in the loop. 
The week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion. I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues. Their disappointment, upset and anger is very understandable. I, along with the entire management team, have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues. 
In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on, we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $5 million fund. We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees. I wanted you to be aware of that. I really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset. 
Last Friday, February 22, we presented to the Creditors' Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program. As can be expected, there was some push back from the committee -- there were issues about some of the data, there were requests for additional data and further clarification. 
The Creditors' Committee formed a subcommittee. We provided to them more data. Jeff McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday, February 27, and we met with them again on Thursday, February 28. We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors' Committee on this program. 
I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is Jeff's and my highest priority. It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future, their future compensation, and any financial safety net, so we are going to have to move on this at light speed. I told the creditors' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court. I'll keep you posted on progress. I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs. Hopefully, by the time we have the employee meeting, we can walk through the composition of the program in detail. 
The powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions. Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week. Then, the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases. And it works its way through the review, approval and communication process. So hopefully, we'll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases. 
We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to Enron $2.1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract. It is a shame we won't be in a position to support the naming of the field, but it is probably in the best interest of the estate. I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning Enron Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees' fund. I'd like your input on that. I thought it was a great idea and very generous. 
We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month. Hopefully I'll be able to meet many of you there. I've tried to get around to say hello here and there. And again, I would encourage you if you have any questions, concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz. Sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you, but I'm making a very concerted effort to answer everybody's inquiries. 
Other than that I don't have a lot to report. We'll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program. Hopefully by next Friday I'll be able to report very substantial progress in this area. I want to thank everybody for their efforts, all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward. 
One other thing... 
We did have a bank meeting on Thursday afternoon. We have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here. We'll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting. I told the bank group, and it was echoed by management, that we believe there is a reorganizable, viable entity in Enron's future. I'll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting. 
Anyway, as I was saying... 
Thanks so much for all your hard work, your efforts, your dedication. I hope you have a great weekend. I'll chat with next week. ",enron_mail/maildir/germany-c/sent_items/664,7,4,35,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,874,59,16,91,65,4.304347826086956,91,994,4756,434,353,12

I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point 
person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.

CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon 
citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one 
has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on 
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it 
but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.

Doug, we billed you incorrectly for June on the CGAS storage.  We should have 
billed you for 1,089,289 but we only entered 497,015 in our system.  We will 
get that fixed.

Subject: Theoretical Storage Inventories


Scott and Chris--Yesterday, I asked Scott if you guys could provide me with a
summary of the volumes of gas sold to CES during April, May, June, and July 
for
the theoretical storage services under our 12/99 Agreement with ENA.   
Attached
is a file that I prepared showing the theoretical storage injections for the 4
storage services as they appear on ENA's monthly invoices.   I note that the
June injection for the TCO storage appears to be only about half of what we
requested and what appears in our GMS system.  My ultimate objective here is 
to
provide The New Power Company with  definitive estimates of the end-of-July
inventories (including left-over inventory from last winter) as well as the
volumes ""injected"" in July alone.  I hope the attached file helps.   If we
could get this resolved next week, that would be great.

Update.  Spoke with the lawyer yesterday.  We can't buy Don out right now.  
We need to turn in the final inventory list, get things resolved with Mary

She still thinks that we won't have any issues with Mary.  After we provide 
the inventory list, she wants me to meet with her (Joal), Mary, and Mary's 
lawyer to see what we need to do to get this CONFLICT resolved.  Joal thinks 
we should be able to do this during the first 2 weeks of November.

 Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into 
our
gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited 
number 
of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity 
somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows: 
For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, the Gathering 
and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig, 
Yellow Creek and Schultz compressor stations.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" 
affected 
are 3219, 3223 and 3224 for the Schultz area and 3214, 3215, 3216, 3217, 
3218, 
3220, 3221 and 3222 for Craig station and 3208, 3209, 3210, 3211, 3212 and 
3213
for Yellow Creek station.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there 
does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor 
stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression 
agreements
will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the 
existing
compressors.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the 
applications 
it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the 
amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.  Dominion 
recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time 
frames.
We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the 
application 
process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once 
granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within 
six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity
will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for
incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will 
award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include 
the 
incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be 
included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
                                Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after
June 12, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. 
Please realize that this is a ""window"" and the opportunity will close after
Noon on June 12, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of 
your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this
opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at 
(304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may 
have regarding this compression  ""open season"" request on Dominion Gathering.

I found a couple of big adjustments on the April capcity sheet.  I am still 
billing CES for the Union Camp capacity and it was terminated effective 
3/31/2000.
  The net impact is $64,104.00 that needs to be credited back to CES.  

It also appears that I billed CES the scheduling fee of $20,000.00 twice.

Jeff, the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $20,000.00 
equals $1,865,705.00.  If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee, then we 
should  issue a credit to CES of about $84,000.00.  Please redraft deal 
227081 and let me know what the impact is.  I would like to send out the 
credit either today or tomorrow.

I think it needs to be pathed in Unify.  Here's the problem.  I created a sales deal ticket and Kim and I didn't know if the supply just needed to come from imbalance or if I needed to create a one sided exchange ticket.  I have no idea how the ontario desk handled it in the past.  They probably were not consistent any.  Would you path this?
 
Just take you best shot on how to do it.  I think we are going to have quite a few things like this.  I'm trying to figure out how to put in a sales deal ticket for Jan 2002 on Montanna Power which is in the west.

Subject: Theoretical Storage Inventories


Scott and Chris--Yesterday, I asked Scott if you guys could provide me with a
summary of the volumes of gas sold to CES during April, May, June, and July 
for
the theoretical storage services under our 12/99 Agreement with ENA.   
Attached
is a file that I prepared showing the theoretical storage injections for the 4
storage services as they appear on ENA's monthly invoices.   I note that the
June injection for the TCO storage appears to be only about half of what we
requested and what appears in our GMS system.  My ultimate objective here is 
to
provide The New Power Company with  definitive estimates of the end-of-July
inventories (including left-over inventory from last winter) as well as the
volumes ""injected"" in July alone.  I hope the attached file helps.   If we
could get this resolved next week, that would be great.

Since we are selling deliverd gas, the Receipt and Delivery volumes should be

Transco
Beverly has all the numbers.  Either Scott or Beavy needs to go into Transit

Beavy has the offer numbers.  We will have (hopefully) 115,000 dt's of pure 
3-3 segmented capacity, all on k#.7537.

Dan, next week we can probably create at least another 40,000 effective next 
Wed.

Tetco
We ran out of credit on ECT.  Scott will talk to Trish Meigs about that in 
the morning.  Kathy has a list of all the offer numbers that need to be 
executed.  AFTER the all offers have been executed, have Meredith check 
screen AN52 effective 4/1/2000.  Kathy, you might be able to do this too.

This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has 
changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 
- 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand 
charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.

Which brings up 2 important points;
 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer 
that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this 
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works 
out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?  
If yes, how many meters?

2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
  Phillips   Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will 
you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you 
can anwser this.

We must have lucked out in June because the commodity variance in June for 
CGAS was only  $4,147.   Is this transport on a SST or FTS contract?  The SST

I just entered a commodity rate on deal 299159.  It has very big volumes on 
it each month and there has not been a commodity rate on it.  Joanne just 
verified that this is regular transport, not Dayton or CALP.  This will be a 
big OA variance for June - August.

This deal is for deliveries to Storage.  Would you verify if ACA and GRI are 
billed for storage deliveries please?

I believe this was suppossed to be a much bigger deal.  There was some

Everything looks fine with the deal except the volumes.  The information that

  Time:  4:00 p.m.
  Place:  Woods on Augusta (pool area)

 I'm heading up north and didn't want to leave without having one
last get together around the pool!!! So, I decided to fire up the grill and
bbq.  I will have some snacks along with the bbq, but any side dishes or
desserts will definitely be enjoyed by one and all.

 Please bring your own ""Cheer"".

 Also, I need a head count for how much bbq to buy. (Get your minds
out of the gutter.) So, please let me know if you're attending.

Dick bought some Agg gas from CNG Field Services Company - deal 143278.  
Kimat entered this as TCO pool deal.  The volume is currently 2187 dth per 
day.  Dick said this volume should increase tomorrow.

Robert, could you call CNG Field Services and get the upstream info?  They 
should give you an agg point - not the IPP pool.

Just got word from EES, they can take the EOG gas.  Marde will show me a

pays a flat $100.00 to transfer gas out of their pool to EES's pool.  Marde 
said the nom for June would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid IF 
+$.09 for gas this month.

EES cannot take any Peoples gas.  Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell 
it to Peoples?  I'm also going to leave a message for Paul at Clinton.  Marde

Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st?  If 
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July.  However, we 
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.

Subject: Re: Peoples  

Questions that I have:
1)  I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool.  It 
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the 
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these 
types of noms.)  This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas 
behind the gate and we don't need more production.  If the customer can't 
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will 
only make my pool longer.

2)  If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest 
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3)  Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount 
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?  

4)  If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be 
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with 
PNG.

Subject: Re: Peoples  

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction 
from Phillips Production Company.  This volume is will be decreased  until 
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the 
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule).  There 
are 7 Phillips meters  in CES's pool beginning July 2000.  Heidi Boyd @ CES 
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool 
until the meters are moved.  EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in 
their pool beginning July 2000.

2.  See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.  


Note:  PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the 
system.  Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force 
Majeure.  Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd 
volume.

Subject: Peoples

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer 
that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this 
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works 
out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?  
If yes, how many meters?

2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
  Phillips   Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will

OK this is metered production on CNG.

Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with.
The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES 
production.

After Gloria lets us know which contract(s) to use, Angie will path this deal

Notice to all Appalachian Pool Operators:           Received 3/29/00  2:00 pm
Reclassification Notice                            Posted 3/29/00  2:00 pm

On February 10, 1999, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549, granting CNG 
Transmission's (CNGT's) request for reclassification of various transmission 
lines to gathering lines.  As part of that Docket, several transmission lines 
were denied to gathering.  On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to 
further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification.   
On March 21, 2000, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549-001, granting 
reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines.  
The newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-19921, LN-943, 
H-124 and H-21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station.  On March 22, 2000, 
CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective 
April 1, 2000.  Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff 
sheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff 
sheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel 
retention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.  If you have 
questions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at 
(304) 623-8698 or Celesta Miracle at (304) 623-8262.

April 3, 2000                                                Received 4/3/00

Dear Pool Operator:

 CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings 
Extraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance 
starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires 
that the ""wet gas"" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in.  
The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no 
unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations 
are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions 
concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed 
to CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area.

 Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets 
other than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m. 
on Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations 
to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight 
and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per 
CNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in CNGT 
considering 
the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your 
pool.

 As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult 
to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your 
pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's 
local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators 
notify producers in their pool of this shut in.  CNGT will not notify 
producers individually.

 We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted 
to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us 
to avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled 
shut       down will not be until 2002.

 If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to 
contact me at (304) 623-8698. 

      Sincerely,



      Nancy M. Aucremanne
      Manager, Producer Services
      And Business Agreements

Chris, 

I created two CES purchase tickets to offset the sales in TRCO Z6 that we are 
not obligated to deliver.  THe ticket numbers are:  345235 and 345230.  I am 
not sure about the pricing on these deals, you might want to take a look at 
them.  If you change something, that is fine, just so that the total volume 
is 494 per day.

Thanks,
Vicki

Its ok to do the netout.  The volumes on deals 502957 and 456379 need to be 
changed but I think that will be handled by Volume Management after they 
enter the pipeline statements in Unify.

Subject:  Theoretical Storage


We need to reach an agreement on the theoretical storage as CES needs to
transfer to NPC a specific volume and price for COH, and AGL ESS, WSS and
Sonat. I had thought we had an understanding that CES would be billed, per
Melissa's memo of 3/15 and conversations during June, the percentages times
the
current month's storage capacity. We may have confused you by sending FOM
noms
for storage injections that were different than that formula, and Doug has
noticed the bills from ENA tend to represent the noms.

How should this be resolved? Should we go on ENA billed volumes or by the
formula? Let me know.
My calculations per the formula would give us the following balances for
7/31/00...
COH-4,053,906
AGL-Sonat- 504,379
AGL-ESS-9,827
AGL-WSS-220,209

Hi Chris, 

I just called you a while ago and they said you'd call me back.? I may not be 
at my phone when you call because I'm at my other desk for the rest of the 
afternoon.

I called to thank you for the goody package I received this afternoon.? 
Hector likes his golf shirt and my pen and pencil are very nice.? I've 
already tested them both.

I'm going to be visiting the New York customers this week and I'll probably 
take my new pen and pencil with me, if I can figure out a way to cover up the 
Enron part.

Hope you are well.? Let's talk soon so we can act like tomatoes and catchup.? 
:) 

Take care.?? ii

This is the way I show the Dayton Power exchange deal starting 1/21/2000, 
please let me know if this is incorrect.

ENA delivered gas to Dayton's TGT citygate.  In return, Dayton is giving ENA 
gas at various CGAS citygates.  There are no fees for this transaction.  The 
TGT deal is 152766, the CGAS deal is 153213.  The volumes on these deals 
should match.  Also, Dayton should not be using any ENA supply (pool gas or 
ENA storage) to supply the CGAS citygate volume.

Comments/questions?

Victor, I did not put a meter number on the CGAS deal.  

Also, it's time to introduce Steve Gillespie to Sitara.

Egan does not have a contract number so Brenda will determine that.  Also,

If you nom from Onshore straigt to Leach, you pay Comm (meaning without ACA

you go from Leach to your TCO pool, you pay the same CGLF stuff and no charge 
on TCO at all.  

Next question, you have SST and you go from the pool to STOI, you pay the SST 
Comm + ACA + GRI into storage.  When you use SST to go from STOW to the 
Citygate, you only pay Comm, no ACA or GRI (i think).

Here is what Vickie told me about capacity on your pipeline after you 
eliminate segmenting.

Example #1

Assumtion: PECO has 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity with a primary 
delivery point of PECO in Z6.
What will Enron and PECO be able to schedule Iff PECO releases 10,000 dt/day 
of St 65 to PECO citygate under the following scenarios;

PECO schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and Enron schedules gas from 
Tetco/Ragley to Z6?

PECO schedules gas from St 30 to St 65, and Enron schedules gas from St 65 to 
Z6?


Assumtion #2: PECO released Enron 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity.

Enron schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and from Tetco/Ragley to Z6?",enron_mail/maildir/germany-c/sent/1319,6,1,4,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,123,3,20,64,22,4.154471544715447,12,149,660,38,59,33

I got to ride in an ambulance to the hospital.  I didn't hear this but the 
Dr. told them to take me to ""a very quiet room"".   He popped my foot back in

Hey team.

I just created deals 456630 (sale to New Power) and 456638 (buy from New 
Power) at the pool.  This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New 
Power when there daily loads drop below the FOM numbers.  I'm using the 
following FOM numbers

1st-6th  51,762
7th-26th  41,762  New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st
27th-31st 31,762 New Power sold Aquilla 10,000 dth 27th-31st

Using these numbers, ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through 
the 25th.  Not as much as I thought.

Why yes we do and here it is.  We create a new worksheet each month.  The 
worksheet you are looking for is ""Rates"".  Assume the rate you are looking at 
is FT unless specified otherwise.   And, depending on what you are looking 
at, we may not have GRI included in the surcharges.  The password to modify

AND, I want to hold back $79,000 of revenue on deal #401601.

The customer price is $5.7025 which is based on the following

Sales Price  $5.4850
Transport to Stoi $.1526  (I included $.0147 too much by accident)
Storge Injection  $.0249
Capacity Demand $.0400

Total Price  $5.7025

We will overinject in October by about 362,000 dth to max out storage by Oct 
31.  Since we will not estimate the transport expense until Oct, I want to 
hold back roughly 362,000 dth x $.2175 = $79,000.00  (close enough).

I spoke with Rich yesterday.  He said it would be OK to net the storage true 
up invoice from Ernie with the Sep invoice.  I mailed the invoice via 
interoffice to Jeff.

There are 6 or 7 deals that ENA billed CES for September that should probably 
be billed to New Power.  All of the deals in question are on the Central desk.

How does the reconciliation look for Jan - June?  Rich said it was his

Just had a thought, according to Joanies worksheet, we can inject a max of 
1,210,121 into storage for the month of May.  For now, our target injection 
volume in storage for May will be 1,210,121.  When we overinject, like we did 
for the first four days, we need to decrease the volumes on deal 231214 for 
the rest of the month so that the total volume on this deal will be 
1,210,121.

I will try to monitor the deal volume.

I spoke with Kelly Edwards (713-544-4692) at Gulf South on Friday regarding our Gulf South contracts 28223 and 28754.

According to Kelly, k#28223 was an Entergy contract and ENA was agent for Entergy.  The rate schedule is NNS.  The agency was cancelled and the bills are being sent directly to Entergy.  She couldn't tell me when the agency was cancelled but she suggested that I call Dave Sommer (281-297-3502) at Entergy to find out more about the contract.  I briefly spoke with Dave Sommer this morning.  He will call me back this afternoon.

Contract 28754 is a FTS rate schedule with a MDQ of 15,000 dth.  The primary receipt point is Vencie and the primary delivery point is Ormet, meter 9122.  The end term on  this contract is June 30, 2003.  I believe ENA used this contract to serve a sale to Ormet, deal 1020612.

Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions.  
This is how it will work,

Deal #  Comment
268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the 
proxy volume
268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the 
proxy volume
268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume 
should not change.


The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 
35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 
268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the 
transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport 
will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 
268093 as the supply for deal 268094.

Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing 
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative 
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression 
into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a 
limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make 
this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a 
period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and 
Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for 
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE 
compressor station.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" affected are 4404 & 4405.   
Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental 
capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental 
capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the 
limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.  
Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it 
receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the 
amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.  
Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing 
time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure 
that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other 
producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression 
in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights 
to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more 
requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for 
which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the 
proposed 
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include 
the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should 
be included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the 
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after 
June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.  
Please realize that this is a ""window"" and the opportunity will close 
after Noon on June 23, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value 
of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on 
this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at 
(304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may 
have regarding this compression  ""open season"" request on Dominion Gathering.

Hi guys.  We need to add the CES demand charges to the East Desk P&L.  The 
impact to the desk is ($694,399).  This includes the demand charge paid to 
CALP and the reimbursements for the Penn Fuel capacity.  It does not include 
any demand charges paid to Dayton Power & Light.  How are we accounting for 
that?

The file is under o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls  Use tab 
CES WHOLESALE.  All the demand charges under CES RETAIL are reimbursed.

I sure we are missing some things.  Scott Goodell will be going through this

Chris,

I'm looking for gas delivered to two Tetco M2 interconnects with TCo.

At the minimum, I'm looking for an offer for a flat baseload volume for 
December flow.  My preference is to get an offer for a flat baseload volume 
from December through March.  The points and volumes are:
 Delmont {Volume:  3,712/day}
 Windrifge {Volume:  2,859/day}

Can I get a nymex plus offer?

Thanks.

James Eckert with Tenn has agreed to have lunch with us on Wednesday.  I 
don't think we all need to go and I don't need to go either.  

He is going to educate us on the VNG contract #47.  The demand charge and 
commodity is discounted effective 11/1/2000.  This is what we know about the 
contract:

MDQ = 16,373 eff 11/1/2000
The 1st 4723/day that we flow is at a discounted  commodity of $.05 and 
discounted demand of $6.08
If we flow more than 4723/day the demand goes to $7.61

What I need to know is exactly how the demand charge will be calculated for 
volumes over 4723 day.
What is the demand charge if we flow 6000/day  for November - 
 is it 141,690 (4723 x 30) @ $6.08 and 38,310 ([6000-4723] x 30) @ $7.61.

Subject: Re: Local Production for June  

If the deal is confirmable as a deal that came across on CES's books 
[reported as an active deal by CES to ENA], then the deal is a CES deal (CES 
- Statoil). BUT, if this is a newly discovered deal - - - - we will need to 
confirm with Risk (Mark Breese) to ensure proper booking & that the deal has 
been quantified; OR if it is a newly negotiated deal or a deal finalized 
after 1/1/00, then it should be entered without the CES prefix (statoil). 
Based on the production dates of deal# 280185 and #226563, as combine with 
the fact and that I can not find anything in the CES deal listing (CES 
'books') specifying a 333/day deal with Statoil I am again hesitant to use 
the CES prefix (nor can I confirm that deal #226563 should have been entered 
with the CES prefix.

John, can you fill in the missing details?

Subject: Local Production for June

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Thanks

Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,

	2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth
	3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did.

Melissa, I had to move the payment to Friday because some Enron ""approval"" people are out of the office but we have a large cash balance and it shouldn't be a problem if it gets delayed untill Monday.

Also, Tiffanie Wheeler discovered an error in my worksheet that impacted the cash balance effective March 1st forward.

I entered deal 477669 in Sitara as a purchase from New Power at the FOM index 
pricing.

Jeff, I believe this works out because we should be increasing our citygate 
sale to you, also at the FOM price.

Jeff, I'm out all next week, just call Joann and she will get the pricing and 
enter the deals.

Also, just so I don't forget, I sold 5000 dth day of TCO Pool to New Power 
for the 10th-30th at $5.68.  I won't enter a deal for this, I just need to 
incorporate it into my citygate pricing.

Pete,  I'm following up the voicemail I left you this morning.
 
In our initial discussions you indicated we could do business under an existing GISB agreement between Enron North America and Reliant.  However, our legal department believes all of our GISB contracts with Reliant have been cancelled/terminated.  Attached is a standard GISB agreement for your review.  I understand that you need to send this to your legal department to include any special provisions that may be necessary.   
 
Please call me at 713-853-4743 or Eric Boyt at 713-345-7754 and let me know if Reliant Energy Services is willing to trade under this agreement.

Subject: FW: A Little Humor to Start Your Day



Computer Gender

An English teacher was explaining to the students
the
concept of gender
association in the English language; noting how
hurricanes at one time were
given only female names, and how ships and planes
were
usually referred to
as ""she."" One of the students raised her hand and
asked,
""What gender is a
computer?""

The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class
into two
groups:  males
in one, females in the other, and asked them to
decide if
a computer should
be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked
to give
four reasons for
their recommendations.

    The group of women concluded that computers
should be
referred to as
masculine because:

1. In order to get their attention, you have to
turn them
on.

2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.

3. They are supposed to help you solve your
problems, but
half the time,
they ARE the problem.

4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that,
if you
had waited a
little longer, you could have had a better model.

    The men, on the other hand, decided that
computers
should definitely be
referred to as feminine because:

1. No one but their creator understands their
internal
logic.

2. The native language they use to communicate
with other
computers is
incomprehensible to everyone else.

3.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in
long-term
memory for later
retrieval.

4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you
find
yourself spending half
your paycheck on accessories for it.

T&F Operating has sent ENA a ""breach of contract"" letter and is requesting to 
terminate the contract effective 4/1/2000.

Colleen, I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer.

CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1, 1999.  
T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market.   The market went away 
effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn 
Fuel's system.  We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and 
according to Penn Fuel, they can't take it either.

T&F is looking for their payment for Jan, Feb, and Mar, and T&F will waive 
any and all ""cover"" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to 
April 1, 2000.

John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this 
need to be included in the CES true-up?  Also, John wants to know if he 
should sign the letter?.  Colleen, I told John you would anwser that 
question.",enron_mail/maildir/germany-c/discussion_threads/956,5,2,20,2,0,0,3,3,9,9,187,9,19,59,27,3.8877005347593583,20,233,960,72,111,23

The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that there cannot be a 
nativity scene in Washington, D.C. this Christmas. The Court ruling is not 
based on the seperation of Church and State  Simply put, the  Court felt it 
could not find three wise men and a virgin in the Nation's capitol. However, 
finding enough Asses to fill the stable would not be a problem.

Chris,

   Columbia Marketing has some outstanding invoices from Jan - Mar of this 
year
for gathering and processing charges against contract 50140 IGS.  I talked 
with
Doug Kinney at CES, and he referred me to you.  Should Enron be paying these
charges?  Do you need me to send copies of the invoices to you, or do you have
an accounting contact for me?

   Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

   PS  Credit tells me that the Jan Gulf invoice is outstanding, also.

Why Exercise???

1) My grandmother started walking five miles a day
 when she was 60.
 She's 97 now & we don't know where the hell she
 is.

 2) The only reason I would take up jogging is so
 that I could hear
 heavy breathing again.

 3) I joined a health club last year, spent about 400
 bucks. Haven't
 lost a pound. Apparently you have to show up.

 4) I have to exercise in the morning before my brain
 figures out what
 I'm doing.

 5) I don't exercise at all. If God meant us to touch
 our toes, he
 would have put them further up our body.

 6) I like long walks, especially when they are taken
 by people who
 annoy me.

 7) I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach
 covers them.

 8) The advantage of exercising every day is that you
 die healthier.

 9) If you are going to try cross-country skiing,
 start with a small
 country.

 10) I don't jog. It makes the ice jump right out of
 my glass.

This deal is starting to get confusing.... so here is the whole deal 
effective 3/21 to 3/31.

63895/8  0/1917/1876  This piece from TCO pool.

No contracts are currently overrun.

Cindy/Kathy/Jesse - we are pulling 19481 from your p20 pool on contract 
63895, which max's out the contract. Any additional Aristech coh 22-3 sale 
will  have to be from TCO pool.

Kara - we are delivering to coh 22-3 as follows:
38011 = 8527
51875 = 3473
60599 = 3000
63895 = 5376

John - I have 550,154 being pulled from p20 for the month. I hope that ties 
to your number. I cannot pull any additional gas from p20, because this would 
overrun your FTS1 contract. The 1 dkt SIT can be made up from Enron's TCO 
pool. Please verify that this is okay. I'll schedule it for 3/23 gas day.

Thank you everyone for your patience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: CES/Aristech deal

I sold CES 2727dt of CGLF mainline gas (deal 221731) effective 21st-31st.  
Aristech only had enough mainline capacity to pull away 751 dt.  I changed 
the volume on this deal and created another sale to CES at the CGAS pool 
(deal 222359) for a volume of 1917 dt.

 2727 - 751 = 1976 at mainline.  
1976 at mainline less fuel of 2.988% = 1917 at the CGAS pool.

Price = $2.77
 .1045  variable cost mainline to Leach
 .0250  demand charge 
 ---------
 2.8995 CGAS price.

Chris,

   Columbia Marketing has some outstanding invoices from Jan - Mar of this 
year
for gathering and processing charges against contract 50140 IGS.  I talked 
with
Doug Kinney at CES, and he referred me to you.  Should Enron be paying these
charges?  Do you need me to send copies of the invoices to you, or do you have
an accounting contact for me?

   Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

The name is PPL ENPLUS which I believe is short for PPL Energy Plus.  I 
purchased 4,752 dt on TRANSCO.  The primary receipt point is CNG-Leidy and 
the primary delivery point is Mainline BG&E.  The offer number is 21575-001.

I feel comfortable that the points listed above are the primary receipt and 
delivery points because of our relationship with Penn Fuel.  Following is the 
example Judy and I discussed with Transco.


EXAMPLE
Assume PSE&G has 100,000 dt of telescoped capacity with a primary delivery 
point of PSE&G, downstream of Linden.  ENA purchases 20,000 dt of telescoped 
capacity from PSE&G under the following scenarios;

1.PSE&G released the capacity with PSE&G as the delivery point.
ENA has primary rights of 20,000 to PSE&G and secondary rights of 20,000 to 
New York (no change, same as before).

ENA could flow 20,000 from the Gulf to BG&E (upstream of the Linden and the 
Leidy Line) on a primary basis.  AND 20,000 from Nat Fuel-Leidy to PSE&G 
which is secondary on the Leidy Line, and Primary on the mainline to PSE&G.  
AND 20,000 from Tenn-Rivervale to BUG on a secondary basis.  These paths are 
not overlapping and ENA could effectivly schedule

Subject: Re: Transco capacity issue  

Colleen/Chris:  I'm working from memory here, but I'm pretty sure that the 
new Order 637 reporting requirements require the Index of Customers to list 
the primary receipt and delivery points.  However, in checking the FERC web 
site, the pipelines are only required to update the Index of Customers 
quarterly.  Therefore, the indices filed under the new reporting requirements 
won't be out until early October.  I will look into this more closely when I 
get back.

Chris -- Is your Penn Fuel release on Transco or Tennessee?  I couldn't find 
""Penn Fuel"" on either the Transco or Tennessee Index of Customers as of 
7/1/00.  Do they have another ""legal"" name?

P.S.  Here in western North Carolina, the high today was about 70 degrees.  
It's sure going to be rough coming back to 100.  But I understand y'all will

Jeff, I believe this works out because we should be increasing our citygate

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

of changing the process effective 11/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.  ENA billed CES (now

Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up

and Tenn will be set up under both desk.  

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.

  On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms,

One correction:  It is our understanding that we will nominate this contract

Subject: International Paper/Union Camp - PLEASE READ

To ensure everyone is on the same page. International Paper/Union Camp 
contract expires with CES Retail to perform the Fuel Management Duties in 
2002. Fred Lombardo has been handling the fuel management responsibilities 
from Pittsburgh and will leave CES at the end of February. CES is outsourcing 
these management responsibilities to Alliance Energy Services. CES has a term 
supply contract with Enron for 6900 delivered to Union Camp and this expires 
at the end of March 2000. CES is in agreement that Enron will continue to 
nominate this gas until the end of March 2000.

The Contract signed between CES and Enron, states that ENA has the agency 
rights for the International Paper Contract. 

Enron's understanding is that Enron will continue to nominate this contract 
until CES's fuel management responsibilities expire in 2002. Colleen and 
Melissa, please ensure both companies are on the same page. Fred Lomabardo 
and his boss, Don Deal, were going to outsource the nomination rights of this 
contract to Alliance Energy. This is not allowed per the Contract language.

In addition, Union Camp does not want to sign the agency agreement required 
by TCO, because it is vague. Enron needs this agreement signed so we can 
nominate the gas under Enron's accounts on TCO. We need CES's help in getting 
this matter resolved ASAP.

Thanks

officially.  Let me chat with Doug Kinney.  I think it will be ok.  I also 
told Doug that my worksheet was probably easier to use when looking at total

Chris,

How the hell are you?

Hope all is well.

I was wondering if you could forward to me a list of all of the pipeline 
capacity and storage assets that you have on behalf of CES.  I am in the 
process of setting up New Power on the respective pipes.

Credit is an issue.  To better know how much credit NPC needs, I thought it 
would be good to see how much FT CES gets on each pipe.
  
Do you maintain a spreadsheet similar to the one you used to maintain for 
EES' assets?

Can you tell what I have?  Make sense?

Thanks.
Mike

Yesterday I was getting ready to fly out of Fletcher's at Hobby airport when 
a man asked if I was with Enron (he saw my United Way shirt most of us were 
wearing yesterday).  He said that he too was an Enron employee but had missed 
the United Way kick-off event.  He told me he was one of our corporate pilots 
and we spoke for several minutes since I had someone waiting at Houston 
Southwest airport to pick me up.  

I asked if I might arrange with him to get a tour of our corporate hanger and 
airplanes and he said he would be glad to arrange such an event.  I told him 
that several of us pilots at Enron might be interested.  He gave me his card 
and said that he had a trip for Tuesday but to just call him when we were 
ready and he would arrange to make it happen.  Soooo... If you are interested

This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has 
changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 
- 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand 
charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.

Which brings up 2 important points;
 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss 
this with CALP (and she may have already)
     However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.

 2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.

Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up 
under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, 
and Tenn will be set up under both desk.  

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.  
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes 
away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same 
contract under both desk.

Frank, I was out last week and I'm just now getting to you email.

As a Marketer, I agree with Dynegy's slide #20, ""the risk of not being able to find replacement capacity (OR CITY GATE GAS SUPPLY) within two hours or less may be too great"" .  The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days.  Also, according to my Transco schedulers, PSE&G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows.  If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&G and the capacity was recalled intra-day, we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&G's nomination and scheduling procedures.  This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&G.


However, we do support intra-day capacity release.

",enron_mail/maildir/germany-c/sent_items/1225,13,10,63,9,2,1,1,1,4,4,151,7,8,52,12,4.125827814569536,14,180,803,60,102,6

1.  Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking

From the Birmingham Sunday Mercury (7th Jan 2001)
  Worker dead at desk for 5 days

  Bosses of a publishing  firm are trying to work out why no one
  noticed that one of their employees had been sitting dead at
  his desk for FIVE DAYS before anyone asked if he was feeling
  okay.  George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a
  proof-reader at a New York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack
  in the open-plan office he shared with 23 other workers.  He
  quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody noticed until
  Saturday morning when an office cleaner  asked why he was
  still working during the weekend.  His boss Elliot Wachiaski
  said ""George was always the first guy in each morning and the
  last to leave at night, so no one found it unusual that he was in
  the same position all that time and didn't say anything.  He was
  always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself.  ""A post
  mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five
  days after suffering a coronary.  Ironically, George was
  proofreading manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.

  You may want to give your co-workers a nudge or kick
  occasionally.

This is a Sithe Energies transaction and in no way has anything to do with our

These other contracts are one ANR, PEPL, Union, TCPL, Empire, and NiMo.

New Virus Taking Offices By Storm
  This virus warning is genuine.

There is a new virus going around, called ""work.""   If you receive any sort
of ""work"" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a
colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT.

This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have
been tempted to open ""work"" or even look at ""work"" have found that their
social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly.  If you
do encounter ""work"" via email or are faced with any ""work"" at all, then to
purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words ""I've had enough
of your crap...  I'm off to the bar.""    Your brain should automatically
forget the ""work"".

If you receive ""work"" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and
drag the ""work"" to your garbage can.  Put on your hat and coat and skip to
the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer  (or rum
punch). After repeating this action 14 times, you will find  that ""work""
will no longer be of any relevance to you  and that ""Scooby Doo"" was the
greatest cartoon ever.

YOU BET.  I'm going to work out after work, go home, get comfy clothes, go by

I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this 
ticket), 268090, and 268093.

Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.  We will show this 
volume coming out in June.  I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the 
volumes coming out in August.

I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.

Let me know if you have any questions.",enron_mail/maildir/germany-c/discussion_threads/1263,1,2,13,5,0,0,2,2,6,6,78,6,10,16,6,3.923076923076923,10,96,402,33,61,29
